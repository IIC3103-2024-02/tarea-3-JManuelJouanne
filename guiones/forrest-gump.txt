"FORREST GUMP"
screenplay by eric roth based on a novel by winston groom
EXT. A SAVANNAH STREET - DAY (1981)
a feather floats through the air. the falling feather. a city, savannah, is revealed in the background. the feather floats down toward the city below. the feather drops down toward the street below, as people walk past and cars drive by, and nearly lands on a man's shoulder. he walks across the street, causing the feather to be whisked back on its journey. the feather floats above a stopped car. the car drives off right as the feather floats down toward the street. the feather floats under a passing car, then is sent flying back up in the air. a man sits on a bus bench. the feather floats above the ground and finally lands on the man's mudsoaked shoe. the man reached down and picks up the feather. his name is forrest gump. he looks at the feather oddly, moves aside a box of chocolates from an old suitcase, then opens the case. inside the old suitcase are an assortment of clothes, a pingpong paddle, toothpaste and other personal items. forrest pulls out a book titled "curious george," then places the feather inside the book. forrest closes the suitcase. something in his eyes reveals that forrest may not be all there. forrest looks right as the sound of an arriving bus is heard. a bus pulls up. forrest remains on the bus bench as the bus continues on. a black woman in a nurse's outfit steps up and sits down at the bus bench next to forrest. the nurse begins to read a magazine as forrest looks at her.
FORREST
hello. my name's forrest gump. he opens a box of chocolates and holds it out for the nurse.
FORREST
you want a chocolate? the nurse shakes her head, a bit apprehensive about this strange man next to her.
FORREST
i could eat about a million and a half of these. my momma always said, "life was like a box of chocolates. you never know what you're gonna get." forrest eats a chocolate as he looks down at the nurse's shoes.
FORREST
those must be comfortable shoes. i'll bet you could walk all day in shoes like that and not feel a thing. i wish i had shoes like that.
BLACK WOMAN
my feet hurt.
FORREST
momma always says there's an awful lot you could tell about a person by their shoes. where they're going. where they've been. the black woman stares at forrest as he looks down at his own shoes.
FORREST
i've worn lots of shoes. i bet if i think about it real hard i could remember my first pair of shoes. forrest closes his eyes tightly.
FORREST
momma said they'd take my anywhere.
INT. COUNTRY DOCTOR'S OFFICE - GREENBOW, ALABAMA - DAY
(1951) a little boy closes his eyes tightly. it is young forrest as he sits in a doctor's office.
FORREST (V.O.)
she said they was my magic shoes. forrest has been fitted with orthopedic shoes and metal leg braces.
DOCTOR
all right, forrest, you can open your eyes now. let's take a little walk around. the doctor sets forrest down on its feet. forrest walks around stiffly. forrest's mother, mrs. gump, watches him as he clanks around the room awkwardly.
DOCTOR
how do those feel? his legs are strong, mrs. gump. as strong as i've ever seen. but his back is as crooked as a politician. forrest walks foreground past the doctor and mrs. gump.
DOCTOR
but we're gonna straighten him right up now, won't we, forrest? a loud thud is heard as, outside, forrest falls.
MRS. GUMP
forrest!
EXT. GREENBOW, ALABAMA
mrs. gump and young forrest walk across the street. forrest walks stiffly next to his mother.
FORREST (V.O.)
now, when i was a baby, momma named me after the great civil war hero, general nathan bedford forrest...
EXT. RURAL ALABAMA
a black and white photo of general nathan bedford forrest. the photo turns into live action as the general dons a hooded sheet over his head. the general is in full ku klux klan garb, including his horse. the general rides off, followed by a large group of klan members dressed in full uniform.
FORREST (V.O.)
she said we was related to him in some way. and, what he did was, he started up this club called the ku klux klan. they'd all dress up in their robes and their bedsheets and act like a bunch of ghosts or spooks or something. they'd even put bedsheets on their horses and ride around. and anyway, that's how i got my name. forrest gump.
EXT. GREENBOW
mrs. gump and forrest walk across the street.
FORREST (V.O.)
momma said that the forrest part was to remind me that sometimes we all do things that, well, just don't make no sense. forrest stops suddenly as his brace gets stuck. forrest's brace is caught in a gutter grate. mrs. gump bends down and tries to free forrest. two old cronies sit in front of a barber shop and watch.
MRS. GUMP
just wait, let me get it. mrs. gump struggles to pull the stuck brace from the grate.
MRS. GUMP
let me get it. wait, get it this way. hold on. forrest pulls his foot out of the grate.
MRS. GUMP
all right. mrs. gump helps forrest up onto the sidewalk. she looks up and notices the two old man.
MRS. GUMP
oooh. all right. what are you all staring at? haven't you ever seen a little boy with braces on his legs before? mrs. gump and forrest walk along the sidewalk past the two old men. mrs. gump holds tightly onto forrest's hand.
MRS. GUMP
don't ever let anybody tell you they're better than you, forrest. if god intended everybody to be the same, he'd have given us all braces on our legs.
FORREST (V.O.)
momma always had a way of explaining things so i could understand them.
EXT. OAK ALLEY/THE GUMP BOARDING HOUSE
mrs. gump and forrest walk along a dirt road. a row of mailboxes stands left.
FORREST (V.O.)
we lived about a quarter mile of route 17, about a half mile from the town of greenbow, alabama. that's in the county of greenbow. our house had been in momma's family since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa had come across the ocean about a thousand years ago. something like that. mrs. gump and forrest walk along the gump boarding house driveway.
FORREST (V.O.)
since it was just me and momma and we had all these empty rooms, momma decided to let those rooms out. mostly to people passing through. like from, oh, mobile, montgomery, place like that. that's how me and mommy got money. mommy was a real smart lady.
MRS. GUMP
remember what i told you, forrest. you're no different than anybody else is. mrs. gump heads forrest to the porch. she bends down to look forrest in the eye.
MRS. GUMP
did you hear what i said, forrest? you're the same as everybody else. you are no different.
PRINCIPAL
your boy's... different, mrs. gump. now, his i.q. is seventy-five.
MRS. GUMP
well, we're all different, mr. hancock. the principal sighs, then stands up.
INT. HALLWAY
forrest sits outside the principal's office and waits.
FORREST (V.O.)
she wanted me to have the finest education, so she took me to the greenbow county central school. i met the principal and all. the principal stands in front of mrs. gump. forrest, sitting left, listens.
PRINCIPAL
i want to show you something, mrs. gump. now, this is normal. the principal holds up a chart with a designations according to i.q. and points to the center of the graph, labeled "normal." a red line below the normal area is labeled "state acceptance." the principal points to the section below the acceptance line labeled "below."
PRINCIPAL
forrest is right here. the state requires a minimum i.q. of eighty to attend public school, mrs. gump. he's gonna have to go to a special school. now, he'll be just fine.
MRS. GUMP
what does normal mean, anyway? he might be a bit on the slow side, but my boy forrest is going to get the same opportunities as everyone else. he's not going to some special school to learn to how to re-tread tires. we're talking about five little points here. there must be something can be done.
INT. HALLWAY
forrest sits outside the principal's office.
PRINCIPAL
we're a progressive school system. we don't want to see anybody left behind.
PRINCIPAL
is there a mr. gump, mrs. gump?
MRS. GUMP
he's on vacation.
EXT. GUMP BOARDING HOUSE - NIGHT
forrest sits on a swing outside the house. loud organic male grunts are heard coming from inside the house. forrest sits on the swing as the grunts continue. the principal steps out of the gump house and wipes the sweat from his face. forrest is sitting on the porch.
PRINCIPAL
well, your momma sure does care about your schooling, son. mm-mm-mm. the principal wipes the sweat from his neck, then looks back at forrest.
PRINCIPAL
you don't say much, do you? forrest grunts, imitating him. the principal, embarrassed, turns and walks away.
INT. GUMP BOARDING HOUSE/FORREST'S BEDROOM
mrs. gump reads from the book "curious george" as forrest sits on the bed and listens.
MRS. GUMP
finally, he had to try it. it looked easy, but, oh, what happened. first there...
FORREST
momma, what's vacation mean?
MRS. GUMP
vacation?
FORREST
where daddy went?
MRS. GUMP
vacation's when you go somewhere, and you don't ever come back. forrest lies down on his bed and looks up.
FORREST (V.O.)
anyway, i guess you could say me and momma was on our own.
EXT. GUMP BOARDING HOUSE - DAY
a cab driver closes the trunk of the car as two women walk toward the house. a milkman steps down from the porch.
FORREST (V.O.)
but we didn't mind. our house was never empty. there was always folks comin' and goin'.
MRS. GUMP (V.O.)
suppa.
INT. GUMP BOARDING HOUSE
mrs. gump steps forward and speaks to all the boarders.
MRS. GUMP
it's suppa, everyone. forrest... a man with a cane steps left across the hall.
MAN WITH CANE
my, my. that sure looks special. mrs. gump looks into a sitting room and informs the boarders about dinner.
MRS. GUMP
gentlemen, would you care to join us for supper? hurry up and get it before the flies do. i prefer you don't smoke that cigar so close to mealtime.
FORREST (V.O.)
sometimes we had so many people stayin' with us that every room was filled with travelers. you know, folks livin' out of their suitcases, and hat cases, and sample cases.
MRS. GUMP
well, you go ahead and start. i can't find forrest. mrs. gump walks up the stairs.
MRS. GUMP
forrest... forrest...
FORREST (V.O.)
one time a young man was staying with us, and he had him a guitar case. mrs. gump looks into forrest's room. she hears singing coming from another room and walks over to a closed door. mrs. gump opens the door, revealing a young man with long sideburns as he plays the guitar and sings. forrest holds onto a broom and dances oddly. the young man is elvis presley.
ELVIS PRESLEY
(sings) "well, you ain't never caught a rabbit, and you ain't no friend of mine." forrest's legs rock back and forth to the guitar.
MRS. GUMP
forrest! i told you not to bother this nice young man.
ELVIS
oh, no, that's all right, ma'am. i was just showin' him a thing or two on the guitar here.
MRS. GUMP
all right, but your supper's ready if y'all want to eat.
ELVIS
yeah, that sounds good. thank you, ma'am. mrs. gump leaves and closes the door. elvis sits back down. forrest stands left, and looks himself in a mirror.
ELVIS
say, man, show me that crazy little walk you just did there. slow it down some. forrest begins to dance again as elvis plays the guitar and sings.
ELVIS
(sings) "you ain't nothin' but a hound, hound dog..."
FORREST (V.O.)
i liked that guitar. forrest dances as he watches himself in the mirror.
FORREST (V.O.)
it sounded good.
ELVIS
(sings) "...cryin' all the time" forrest rocks up and down on his braced legs, then begins to step.
ELVIS
(sings) "you ain't nothin' but a hound dog..."
FORREST (V.O.)
i started moving around to the music, swinging my hips. this one night me and momma...
EXT. GREENBOW - NIGHT
mrs. gump and forrest walk along a sidewalk. a television inside a store window reveals elvis presley as he performs "houng dog" on a stage.
FORREST (V.O.)
...was out shoppin', and we walked right by benson's furniture and appliance store, and guess what. the television reveals elvis as he thrusts his hips and sings.
ELVIS
(sings) you ain't nothin' but a hound dog... mrs. gump and forrest watch the television. elvis dances around in the same manner forrest did. a woman in the audience screaming and applauding.
ELVIS
(sings) you ain't nothin' but a hound dog...
MRS. GUMP
this is not children's eyes. mrs. gump walks away, pulling forrest with her. forrest stops and takes one last look. elvis continues to perform over the television.
ELVIS
(sings) "well, you ain't never caught a rabbit and you ain't no friend of mine."

EXT. SMALL EASTERN TOWN

YOUNG MAN

FORREST
now, for some reason what i was doing seemed to make sense to people.
EXT. SMALL EASTERN TOWN
the young man jobs behind forrest.
YOUNG MAN
i mean, it was like an alarm went off in my head, you know. i said, here's a guy that's got his act together. here's somebody who's got it, all figured out. here's somebody who has the answer. i'll follow you anywhere, mr. gump.
FORREST (V.O.)
so, i got company. forrest runs up a slope on a high mountain road. a group of people are jogging behind him.

and after that i got more company. and then... a large group jogs behind forrest across the desert road.
FORREST (V.O.)
...even more people joined in. somebody later told me...

...it gave people hope. now... now, i don't know anything about that, but... forrest and his followers job through a small town. a man runs up and talks to forrest.
FORREST (V.O.)
some of those people asked me if i could help them out.
AGING HIPPIE
hey, man, hey, listen. i was wondering if you might help me, huh? listen, i'm in the bumper sticker business and i've been trying to think up a good slogan. and since you have been such a big inspiration to the people around here, i thought you might be able to help me jump into... whoa! man, you just ran through a big pile of dogshit! the hippie jumps over the "dogshit" as he runs along forrest.
FORREST
it happens.
AGING HIPPIE
what, shit?
FORREST
sometimes. the hippie stops to ponder this profound thought.
FORREST (V.O.)
and some years later i heard that fella did come up with a bumper sticker slogan... a bumper sticker reads "shit happens."
FORREST (V.O.)
...and he make a lot of money off of it. the truck with the bumper sticker drives into an intersection. it collides with a car.
EXT. TRUCK STOP
forrest runs, followed by his group, as a man runs up to him.
FORREST (V.O.)
another time i was running along, somebody who had lost all his money in the t-shirt business, and he wanted to put my face on a t-shirt, but he couldn't draw that well and he didn't have a camera.
WILD-EYED MAN
i think it would be really fortunate for me if i could get your name on these, oh, your face and name on these t-shirts. it would be wonderful. a truck splashes mud onto forrest as it goes by. the man hands forrest a yellow t-shirt to use as a rag to wipe the mud off.
WILD-EYED MAN
here, use this one. nobody likes that color anyway. forrest wipes his face on the towel and hands it back to the man.
FORREST
have a nice day. the man looks at the t-shirt. he holds it up displaying the "happy face."
FORREST (V.O.)
and some years later i found out that that man did come up with a idea for a t-shirt and he made a lot of money off of it.
EXT. MONUMENT VALLEY
forrest runs with a group that follows behind him.
FORREST (V.O.)
anyway, like i was saying, i had a lot of company. my momma always said you got to put the past behind you before you can move on. and i think that's what my running was all about. i had run for three years, two months, fourteen days, and sixteen hours. forrest stops running. the group stops behind him. forrest stands and looks as the group waits expectantly. forrest turns and look.
YOUNG MAN
quiet. quiet, he's gonna say something.
FORREST
i'm pretty tired. i think i'll go home now. forrest walks toward the group. the group parts for forrest as he walks down the middle of the road.
YOUNG MAN
now what are we supposed to do?
FORREST (V.O.)
and just like that, my running days was over. so, i went home to alabama. a television shows president reagan and his staff as they react to gunshots in front of a limo.

ELDERLY WOMAN
