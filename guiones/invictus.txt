(aka "the human factor") written by anthony peckham based on material by john carlin second draft 5/22/07 "sport has the power to change the world. it has the power to inspire, the power to unite people that little else has ... it is more powerful than governments in breaking down racial barriers."
EXT. ALL-WHITE HIGH SCHOOL, WESTERN CAPE - DAY
a big, rich, powerhouse all-white high school located near the freeway into cape town. the rugby fields are immaculate. fifteen year old boys in striped rugby jerseys train with total intensity under the critical eye of the coach. right across the boundary fence from the rugby fields is an area of waste land leading up to the freeway. there, black and "colored" (mixed-race) boys of the same age play a loose game of soccer with a tennis ball. most of them have bare feet and threadbare, dirty clothes, most of them are noticeably smaller and skinnier than the white boys. two cultures, separated by more than the high boundary fence.
SUPER TITLE: SOUTH AFRICA, FEBRUARY 11, 1990
a commotion on the freeway intrudes on the soccer game. horns honking, cars pull over onto the shoulder, people jump out.
EXT. FREEWAY - DAY
lead by police motorbikes, then patrol cars, a white mercedes approaches, heading towards cape town. whoever is in the mercedes has stopped traffic.
EXT. ALL-WHITE HIGH SCHOOL, WESTERN CAPE - DAY
the soccer players abandon their game and run for the freeway, whistling and shouting. the rugby players are more disciplined -- or obedient -- and do not acknowledge the commotion until the convoy passes right by them. the coach shakes his head in disgust.
HIGH SCHOOL BOY
who is it, sir?
COACH
it's that terrorist, mandela. they let him out.
(BEAT)
remember this day, boys. it's the day our country went to the dogs.
CUT TO:
2. a short, stock-footage montage which spans the tumultuous four years between nelson mandela's release from prison and his inauguration as president of south africa. footage would include: - mandela's release from prison - negotiations with the apartheid regime - scenes of white fear and emigration - the horrifying sectarian violence leading up to the
ELECTIONS
- the khaki-clad awb (afrikaner right wing) attack on the world trade center (where negotiations were taking place) - the lifting of economic sanctions and cultural boycotts - the lifting of the international ban on the springbok rugby team and immediate test match losses to new zealand and australia. - popular black leader chris hani's assassination by white

- black retaliation - mandela's frantic intervention to keep the country from going up in flames - the election itself, with those incredible images of thousands and thousands of people, black and white, lining up patiently, some to vote for the first time in their lives - the african national congress victory - mandela's inauguration as president, where he delivers the
FAMOUS WORDS:
"never, never and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will again experience the oppression of one by another, and suffer the indignity of being the skunk of the world." as applause fades ...
INT. MANDELA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
dark. we can make out the form of a tall man sleeping alone at the very edge of the big bed, as if not wanting to rumple the blankets too much. on the bedside table, the clock clicks from 4:59 to 5:00. the man's eyes open in the dark, instantly awake. he reaches out, switches on the light. nelson rolihlahla mandela, 76, sits up and gets out of bed in one movement. he has the physical vigor and energy of someone twenty years younger. 3. the second he is up, he turns around and makes his bed, leaving it as flawlessly smooth as a hospital bed. or a prison bunk. for this is the discipline of twenty seven years behind bars.
INT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
dressed in a tracksuit and cross-trainers, mandela comes down the stairs and heads for the front door. this is a nice, big house but it is amazingly modest for the president of a wealthy nation, and arguably the most famous man on the planet.
EXT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
mandela steps outside, closes his front door quietly, takes a moment to savor the air. it is bone dry and cold -- typical conditions in the highveld at this time of year. it is so quiet that, for a moment, it seems as if mandela is completely alone in the world. the big yard is fenced. there is a small guard house at the driveway gate. when mandela steps away from the house, a uniformed south african policeman in the guardhouse pushes the button that opens the gate.
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
when the gate begins to open we see that there are two grey bmws parked either side of it.
INT. GREY BMW - NIGHT
linga moonsamy comes to full alert as the gate opens. he is a big, scowling man dressed in a suit. he checks the load on a pistol, tucks it into his shoulder holster.
LINGA
here he comes. like clockwork.
JASON
it makes him such an easy target. 4. behind linga, in the back seat, sits jason tshabalala, a naturally tense and suspicious man. both of them are hollow- eyed, exhausted, running on adrenaline. they get out of the bmw, fast and quiet. this does not look good.
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
as mandela walks out through the gate, jason and linga intercept him.
JASON
(traditional greeting in
XHOSA)
i see you, father. mandela's face comes alive as he smiles.
MANDELA
(without breaking stride) morning boys. how are you? jason is mandela's head of personal security, linga his number one bodyguard. they are both former "terrorists", and they are utterly devoted to mandela.
JASON
we're sharp, madiba.
MANDELA
good ... good. and how's your mother doing, linga?
LINGA
she's much better, thank you.
MANDELA
good. mandela picks up the pace. jason and linga fall back, so that they are a few steps behind him. they share a quick look. they hate this walk. it scares them. there's no way for it to be anything but completely unsanitary, from a security point of view.

EXT. JOHANNESBURG STREETS - NIGHT
a small delivery van drives really fast, blows through stop signs.
EXT. HOUGHTON STREETS - NIGHT
mandela strides along the big, wide, tree-lined streets. jason and linga shadow him, eyes and ears alert. up ahead, we see a small, upscale area of shops and
EXT. SMALL, UPSCALE SHOPS - NIGHT
mandela, jason and linga reach the shopping area. dark, deserted.
CUT TO:
another angle of the shops as the small van turns onto the street with a squeal of tires.
CUT TO:
the sliding door on the van is opened from inside. too dark to see in. ominous.
CUT TO:
mandela, jason and linga pass a huge poster of mandela in the window of corner grocery. mandela does not react to this giant picture of himself, jason and linga do, proudly -- (a general note: starting with the window of this grocery, there are pictures of mandela everywhere. magazine covers, newspaper centerfolds, t-shirts, children's art -- as if to make up for all the time mandela's image and words were banned.) -- until they hear the sound of the van tearing towards them. they turn, see headlights veering to their side of the
STREET.
6. both men drop their hands to their guns. linga steps in front of mandela, shielding him, jason steps out wide, ready for anything. mandela is completely calm. the van screeches to a halt just past them. a guy jumps out of the van holding a tied bundle of newspapers, which he drops with a thump at the grocery door. the guy doesn't see them. the delivery van is gone before the newspapers stop moving. mandela heads for the newspapers -- he wants to see the headlines. jason and linga take their hands off their guns, but they do not relax. these are dangerous times. go in on the top newspaper, which shows a photo of the inauguration, and the following words, in afrikaans: he can
JASON
what does it say?
MANDELA
it says, "he can win an election, but can he run a country?"
(DISGUSTED)
not even one day on the job and they're after you.
MANDELA
it's a legitimate question. mandela turns and marches for home. jason and linga fall in behind him. in the east, the first milky hint of day.
INT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - BEFORE DAWN
the house is now bustling with activity. a pretty member of the kitchen staff sets a single place at the head of a big, formal dining table. a lady chef stirs the porridge, a kitchen assistant cuts fresh fruit. mandela's personal secretary, mary marches out of her small office with a stack of correspondence and five newspapers, places them neatly next to the table setting. 7. outside, mandela is surrounded by men. inside, he has surrounded himself with women of all shapes, colors and ages, to make up for twenty seven years without.
CUT TO:
mandela shaves upstairs in the bathroom. the razor is dull. mandela opens drawers looking for another. he opens a drawer that is empty but for a woman's beaded bracelet, broken and shedding tiny colored beads. mandela looks for it for a moment, then closes the drawer, looks at himself in the mirror. mostly, mandela's face is warm, animated, energetic and this is how we see him, almost all the time. but, sometimes, his face can be a remote, sphinx-like mask that conceals all emotion, all feeling. this is his prison face. this is the face that looks back at mandela, right now, in the mirror. it is the face of a man whose long, hard journey has marked his very soul. expressionless, mandela shaves himself with the dull razor. over, a cock crows and --
CUT TO:
-- a quick series of shots, as the rainbow nation wakes up.
TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
today marks the beginning of a new era in south africa -- from the bush to the cities, from shanty towns to ocean-front mansions, people start their day.
TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
-- as president mandela takes office in pretoria, facing issues that range from economic stagnation and unemployment to rising crime -- some start the day with a tea tray placed next to their beds by discreet black hands, some with nothing more than brown river water and half a fire-blackened ear of corn for breakfast. 8.
TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
-- while at the same time balancing black aspirations --
TV ANNOUNCER
-- with white fears. click! the tv is turned off by mr. pienaar (late 40's) in his very modest, blue-collar house.
(GLOOMY)
i never thought i'd see the day. mr. pienaar turns and addresses his son, francois pienaar, 27, a big, blond, almost-handsome man with a fighter's face and mangled ears. brutal toughness and honor in his features. a powerful physical presence, possibly dangerous. francois drips with sweat, wears running clothes. whatever he does, he is strong, fit and driven.
MR. PIENAAR
i feel sorry for you, son. you've got your whole life ahead of you. what's it going to be like now? mrs. pienaar (late 40's) enters holding some kind of protein shake for pienaar.
MRS. PIENAAR
don't be so gloomy. (handing over shake) i added vitamins -- there's a horrible flu bug going around. tell nerine when you get home.
PIENAAR
thanks, ma.
MR. PIENAAR
i'm telling you, francois -- look at angola, look at mozambique. look at zimbabwe. we're next. they're going to take our jobs and drive us into the sea. just you wait.

EXT. UNION BUILDINGS, PRETORIA - DAY
magnificent, sweeping government buildings made of carved african field stone, with an italian tiled roof, situated on a hill overlooking pretoria. the seat of power. today, the entrance is mobbed with a huge, joyous, multi- racial throng, plus news crews from all over the world. lots of new south african flags evident. we move through the throng and swoop up into the air, so that we can soar along the outside of the building and look through the windows into the offices of state -- -- where people who worked for the de klerk regime are packing up, in anticipation of being booted out by the mandela regime. these characters run the gamut from little old afrikaner tea ladies in tears, to the stoic fossils of grand apartheid. they are all white. a good third of the offices are already deserted. the deserted offices have open doors. through a window, through an open door, we see mandela and his bodyguards striding down a union building hallway. we swoop in through the window --
INT. UNION BUILDING HALLWAYS - DAY
-- and catch up with the new president. mandela is regal in a magnificent tailored suit. jason in front, linga behind. portraits of the architects and champions of apartheid look down sternly on them as they pass. they pass a worker hanging a portrait of mandela next to one of de klerk, the previous president. on linga, as he smiles at that. mandela, on the other hand, looks into the empty offices, and into the offices being packed up. up ahead, the double doors to the office of the president, are closed. jason speeds up, opens them, pokes his head in, then opens the doors wide.
JASON
(with great pride) after you, mr. president. 10.
INT. MANDELA'S OFFICES - DAY
mandela's offices are fronted by a large reception area, already filled with people waiting to see him. to one side are his chief of staff's suite of offices, to the other side, the small presidential security office. beyond these are mandela's secretaries, typists and assistants -- his gatekeepers. beyond that is the inner sanctum, mandela's own office. the phones are ringing off the hook. fax machines are chattering. everyone wants a piece of mandela. mandela enters, jason and linga behind him.
MANDELA
good morning everybody.
(GREETINGS)
barbara masekela, mandela's chief of staff (and now ambassador to the u.s.), emerges from her office, carrying an arm load of files, folders and papers --
MANDELA
barbara, good morning. you've had your hair done. i like it. -- accompanies mandela back towards his office.
BARBARA
thank you, madiba. we need to talk about your cabinet appointments and ministers.
MANDELA
give me one moment, please. barbara waits outside mandela's office, as he enters ahead of her.
INT. MANDELA'S OFFICE - DAY
mandela stands in the middle of his office, takes a moment to savor where he is. 11. then, he takes off his jacket, hangs it up and is ready for work.
BARBARA --
barbara enters.
MANDELA
-- please assemble the staff for me. whoever has not already left.
BARBARA
right now? all of them?
MANDELA
yes, please.
INT. UNION BUILDING STAFF DINING ROOM - DAY
what's left of the union building staff are packed into the dining room. white faces, bitter and resentful. waiting to be fired. through the glass doors, they see mandela approaching down the hallway, linga and jason with him.
STAFF MEMBER#1
here he comes.
STAFF MEMBER#2
he wants the satisfaction of firing us himself. they stand up straight, determined to receive the ax with pride.
INT. UNION BUILDING HALLWAYS - DAY
linga and jason amp up when they see the room full of restless afrikaners. at the staff dining room door, mandela turns to them.
MANDELA
i'd like you to stay out here, please.
JASON
but, madiba ... 12.
MANDELA
i cannot talk to them if i'm hiding behind men with guns. mandela opens the doors and enters. jason and linga stay outside ... just.
INT. UNION BUILDING DINING ROOM - DAY
mandela enters, smiles -- gets not one smile in return.
(IN AFRIKAANS)
gooie more almal.
(ASIDE)
does he think greeting us in afrikaans makes this any sweeter?
MANDELA
some of you may know who i am. this gets a few bitter chuckles. mandela is at this best just talking to people, like this. only, he doesn't just talk to them, he wades in amongst them, shaking hands and making individual contact as he speaks to all of them.
MANDELA
good morning ... how are you ... thank you for coming at such short notice ... etc.
QUICK CUT TO:
mandela is a continual security nightmare. you can see the tension on jason and linga's faces as he disappears into the throng.
BACK TO:
when mandela reaches the middle of the room, he stops shaking hands, and turns slowly as he talks to everybody.
MANDELA
i couldn't help noticing the empty offices as i came to work today. and all the packing boxes. one black man, surrounded by a throng of serious white faces. 13.
MANDELA
now, of course, if you want to leave, that is your right. and if you feel in your heart that you cannot work with your new government, then it is better that you do leave, right away. he can be tough and blunt, when necessary.
MANDELA
but if you are packing up because you fear that your language, or the color of your skin, or who you served previously, disqualifies you from working here now, i am here to tell you, have no such fear.
(BEAT)
wat is verby is verby. what's past is past. we look to the future, now. this is not what they expected to hear.
MANDELA
we need your help. we want your help. if you would like to stay, you will be doing your country a great service. mandela pauses, to look at the faces. they are receptive.
MANDELA
i ask only that you do your jobs to the best of your abilities, and with good hearts. i promise to do the same.
(BEAT)
if we can manage that, our country will be a shining light in the world.

INT. MANDELA'S OFFICES - DAY
mandela heads back through to his office, barbara, mary and other assistants forming a phalanx around him. linga peels off, goes into the security office. jason stands at the desk of one of the assistants (jessie), waits for her to finish a call, then:
JASON
molo, sister.
(FRAZZLED)
it's still morning? jason grins.
JASON
when you get a chance, can we see the schedule for the month? we need to plan security. jessie's phone rings.
(ANSWERING PHONE)
office of the president, good morning. jessie waves jason off. he crosses to the security office, enters.
INT. SECURITY OFFICE - DAY
once he closes the door behind him, jason shows his fatigue. linga is feet-up on the sofa, sucking on a cup of coffee. three more bodyguards -- sam, kwezi and winston -- slump in chairs. jason grabs coffee, sits at his desk, puts his feet up with a groan.
JASON
we need more men.
LINGA
did you talk to barbara about it?
JASON
yesterday. 15. a knock at the door.
JASON
that's jessie, with the schedule.
(LOUDLY)
come in, beautiful. the door opens -- but what enters is not beautiful. four big white cops in suits enter, special branch written all over them. etienne van eck, hendrick booyens, george and
WILLEM.
the bodyguards stand up like junk yard dogs protecting their territory.
JASON
what is this?
ETIENNE
mr. jason tshabalala?
JASON
that's me. am i under arrest? etienne snaps out a crisp salute.
ETIENNE
captain van eck and team reporting for duty, sir. hendrick, george and willem snap out salutes. their military deportment contrasts strongly with the less rigid body language of the black bodyguards.
JASON
what duty?
ETIENNE
we're the presidential bodyguard. we've been assigned to this office. (holding out a sheet of
PAPER)
here are our orders. jason takes the orders, studies them, face increasingly angry.
(TO HENDRICK)
you're special branch, right? 16. hendrick nods, sternly. linga, sam, kwezi and winston react to that -- there is a long and brutal history between them and the special branch.
ETIENNE
you'll see that they've been signed.
JASON
i don't care if they're signed or -- jason does a double-take when he sees the signature on the orders: nelson r. mandela.
JASON
wait here. jason storms out, holding the orders. the four black bodyguards seethe with hostility. the four white bodyguards stare straight ahead, refusing to give ground.
INT. MANDELA'S OFFICE - DAY
mandela and barbara look over a position paper on something or other. when jason knocks and enters, they pause.
JASON
sorry to disturb you.
MANDELA
you look agitated, jason.
JASON
that's because i've got four special branch cops in my office.
MANDELA
what have you done?
JASON
me? nothing. they say they're the presidential bodyguard. they have orders.
(BEAT)
signed by you.
MANDELA
yes. they've had special training, those boys -- with the sas. and lots of experience. they protected de klerk. 17.
JASON
yes, but --
MANDELA
you asked for more men, didn't you?
JASON
yes, but --
MANDELA
in public, when people see me, they see my bodyguards, too. you represent me, directly. the rainbow nation starts here.
(BEAT)
reconciliation starts here.
JASON
reconciliation? madiba, not long ago they tried to kill us! maybe even these four guys. they tried and, often, they succeeded!
INT. SECURITY OFFICE
linga, sam, winston and kwezi stare down etienne, hendrick, george and willem.
INT. MANDELA'S OFFICE - DAY
mandela stares at jason in an entirely different way -- with wisdom, compassion and sympathy.
MANDELA
yes, i know.
(VERY GENTLY)
forgiveness starts here, too. mandela lets that sink in for a moment. he knows he asks for something very difficult, but he demands it of himself to an even greater degree.
MANDELA
forgiveness liberates the soul. it removes fear. that is why it is such a powerful weapon, jason.
(MORE)
18.
(BEAT)
please try it. jason exhales. he isn't remotely ready to forgive.
JASON
yes, madiba. sorry to disturb you. jason turns, leaves. barbara shakes her head at mandela.
BARBARA
you ask a lot.
MANDELA
only what is necessary.
EXT. MANDELA'S OFFICES - DAY
as jason -- very upset -- walks back to security, jessie holds out a file for him.
JESSIE
two copies of the schedule. jason snatches the file, keeps walking.
JESSIE
thank you, jessie! when he reaches the security office door, jason walks right past, keeps going, has to make a full loop of the reception area, just to get himself together. even so, when he gets back to the security office door, jason pauses, gathers himself to do something that he knows he's going to hate.
INT. SECURITY OFFICE - DAY
things haven't eased up one little bit inside the office. the silence is deafening. jason enters, looks them all over. his face is grim.
LINGA
can we get rid of these guys, now? jason flashes a look at linga, then -- and this hurts him, visibly -- he holds out one of mandela's schedules to etienne. 19.
JASON
this is his schedule for the next month. let's look it over for duty assignments.
ETIENNE
right.
LINGA
what? linga and the others are shocked.
LINGA
jason, i have to talk to you. outside. linga virtually pulls jason out of the office.
INT. MANDELA'S OFFICES - DAY
just outside the security office door, so they keep their voices low.
LINGA
how can we trust them?
JASON
we can't. (heading back in) this is what madiba wants, okay. not okay for linga, judging by the expression on his face.
INT. SECURITY OFFICE - DAY
when jason and linga enter, etienne looks up from mandela's schedule.
ETIENNE
are there any special orders or conditions?
JASON
no. yes. madiba gets upset if you don't smile when you push people out of the way.
HENDRICK
seriously? 20.
LINGA
yes, seriously. it's the new south africa.
ETIENNE
madiba?
JASON
the president's clan name. it's what we call him. the new bodyguards share a look. they're not comfortable with "madiba".
ETIENNE
we'll call him mr. president. jason lifts the schedule.
JASON
let's get through this. still upset and hostile, the black bodyguards look over jason's shoulder, the white bodyguards look over etienne's, at the month's schedule. apartheid is by no means dead in this cramped little office. both teams study and discuss the schedule -- (shop talk tbd
THE LIFE OF M.)
etienne shakes his head.
ETIENNE
how's he going to do all this? when does he take a break?
LINGA
he says he rested enough in prison. jason recoils at something he sees on the last page of the schedule.
JASON
here's a headache.
LINGA
what? 21.
JASON
a rugby match at loftus versfeld. british lions against the springboks.
HENDRICK
it's going to be a headache for the lions, that's for sure. we're going to donder them.
JASON
i don't care about the game. i care that the president'll be so exposed.
LINGA
to thousands of drunken --
(INNOCENTLY)
-- sports fans?
JASON
yes. sports fans.
LINGA
who didn't vote for him. who probably hate him. who came out of the womb with guns in their hands.
EXT. LOFTUS VERSFELD STADIUM - DAY
a huge, raucous crowd, almost entirely white and male. many wearing the springbok green and gold. widespread evidence of drinking. lots of old south african flags -- the blue, white and orange apartheid flag -- make a defiant statement against the new south african flags ringing the stadium. on the field, the rugby teams assemble and face each other in two lines. the british lions in their white on white with black and red trim, the springboks in their green and gold. like their supporters, the springboks are all white, but for one man, who is "colored" (mixed race). 22. big, tough, brutal-looking men. scary. (we may or may not notice francois pienaar, standing at the head of the line of springboks.)
INT. LOFTUS VERSFELD STADIUM - TUNNEL ONTO FIELD - DAY
at the entrance of the tunnel onto the field, lots of cops in blue south african police uniforms. behind the line of cops, in the tunnel, we find jason and all the other bodyguards but for linga. they are keyed-up, intense -- none more so than jason.
JASON
(shouting against the
NOISE)
i want your eyes on the crowd at all times. we're staying in the middle of the field. he's going to walk out, shake hands, walk back. nothing else. got it? they nod. they are like the players at game time, only the stakes are much higher. jason looks deeper into the tunnel, straightens up.
JASON
here we go. mandela strides down the tunnel towards them, wearing a dark suit. big crowds energize him. his eyes are alive with excitement. one pace behind him, like a huge, dark shadow, comes linga. mandela gives jason a look, jason nods. we follow mandela and the bodyguards out of the tunnel --
EXT. LOFTUS VERSFELD STADIUM - DAY
-- onto the field, towards the waiting teams. the crowd rise to their feet. lots of them jeer mandela, lots cheer. all the old south african flags are waved at him defiantly -- plus some new ones. mandela waves to them all, smiling proudly. to him, a crowd is an opportunity to make new friends. but he stays in the center of the field. 23. jason and crew are hyper-alert, a human fence around mandela. mandela reaches the rugby players. waiting for him at the head of the springbok line, wearing the number 6 jersey and captain's armband, is francois pienaar. now we know what he does. mandela extends his hand.
MANDELA
good luck, captain.
(SHAKING HANDS)
thank you, sir. mandela shakes hands down the line of springboks, then returns, shaking hands with the british lions. quick, perfunctory handshakes. as mandela does this, we take bodyguard pov snapshots of the crowd, increasingly keyed-up and restless. time to play rugby. mandela finishes, waves to the crowd, and begins the walk along the center of the field, back to the tunnel. crowd noise increases. they know the opening whistle is about to blow. then, mandela sees something in the crowd, at field level.
NEW SOUTH AFRICAN FLAG AT HIM.
without warning, mandela changes direction, heads towards this group, towards a wall of his former -- and perhaps current -- enemies. on jason: shit!
(INTO RADIO)
stay with him.
ETIENNE
stop him.
JASON
stay with him. 24. with his bodyguards scrambling to stay in position, mandela reaches the stands, hand outstretched, leans into the crowd.
MANDELA
thank you for honoring our new flag! some shake his hand, some -- very pointedly -- do not. the crowd noise takes on an ugly undertone -- mandela is delaying the rugby. mandela is undeterred. he's into this one-on-one outreach. he turns, looks for more hands to shake -- -- and jason steps in between mandela and the crowd.
JASON
we're delaying the rugby, madiba.
MANDELA
oh, yes, of course. mandela gives one last wave, turns away. as he does, someone winds up and throws something from the stands. jason and etienne catch the movement, whirl, too late. an orange whizzes past mandela's head, explodes juicily on the field. mandela didn't see it, doesn't react. if anything, his smile widens as he heads across the field. the bodyguards close around him protectively, get him back to the tunnel.
INT. LOFTUS VERSFELD STADIUM - TUNNEL ONTO FIELD - DAY
jason signals for extra bodyguards to escort mandela all the way up to his box. hendrick, the biggest, leads the way. jason stays in the tunnel, along with etienne. both men are in a muck sweat, adrenaline coursing through them.
ETIENNE
why didn't you stop him?
JASON
next time, you try. 25.
ETIENNE
does he do that sort of thing all the time?
JASON
ask my ulcer.
(BEAT)
good thing that was just an orange.
ETIENNE
and good thing he never saw it.
JASON
oh, he saw it. he sees everything. (rubbing his ulcer) i hate rugby.
EXT. LOFTUS VERSFELD STADIUM - DAY
two international front rows come together with bone- crunching force. huge, violent men grunt like bulls. the crowd roar vibrates the stadium. the scrum -- a phalanx of eight men locked together against eight -- wheels, buckles, then steadies under the watchful eye of the referee. fanning out behind each scrum are the backs -- faster, more glamorous players who will run with the ball, or kick it. the lions scrumhalf thrusts the ball into the maw of the scrum, the huge men lock up against each other with maximum force. the ball comes out the back of the lions' scrum, the scrumhalf dive-passes it away to the backs, who flick it out laterally to the wing, with lightning speed. the wing lofts a delicate kick just over the onrushing springbok defenders. the lions charge the ball, which bounces erratically -- -- right into the hands of the man who kicked it. one last burst of speed, one quick juke to avoid a desperation tackle, and the wing scores in the corner. as the lions kicker gets ready to convert the try, we find the springboks huddling under their goal posts, hands on their hips, stunned. 26. at the center of the huddle pienaar bleeds behind his gum guard as, furiously, he tries to inject some fire into his team.
PIENAAR
concentrate, dammit! focus! we can beat these guys if we play our game, not theirs! on pienaar, as he realizes he is not getting through. there is dullness, shock in his player's eyes -- -- which all lift to the heavens as the conversion kick soars through the uprights. we follow the kick as it drops past a giant scoreboard. stay on the scoreboard as it registers the conversion and shows the score: lions - 10 springboks - 0
INT. LOFTUS VERSFELD STADIUM VIP BOX - DAY
in the vip box, mandela turns his back on the field as the game restarts beneath him and continues in the background. he has binoculars around his neck.

yes, we do. mary pours tea at the back of the box. linga stands two steps behind mandela. on mandela's left, sits the president of south african rugby, a small man with a small man's ruthlessness and drive.
MANDELA
it's not too late, if the boys can just pick up their game.
RUGBY PRESIDENT
if they don't, heads will roll. this is unacceptable.
(LEANING FORWARD)
come on you bloody bastards! 27. mandela's expression shows that he has a gentleman's distaste for profanity. he turns to barbara.
BARBARA
where do you want go first, for foreign investment?
MANDELA
where the money is. america, england, saudi arabia. barbara makes notes. mandela lifts his binoculars, but instead of looking at the rugby, he looks at the crowd.
CUT TO:
mandela's pov through binoculars -- mandela zeroes in on an old south african flag -- the apartheid flag. it is being held by the four khaki-clad boers (farmers). classic south african figures from the rural far north, they are already drunk and suicidally depressed by the turn of events on the field.
BARBARA
do you see all the old apartheid flags? it's a disgrace. mandela lowers his binoculars.
MANDELA
it's also a constitutional right.
BARBARA
along with the apartheid anthem. i know. but it's time people moved on. mandela grunts, raises his binoculars again.
CUT TO:
mandela's pov through binoculars -- mandela finds a small knot of black spectators, holding the new south african flag and cheering ecstatically.
CUT TO:
28.
MANDELA
look at that. the whites are cheering for the springboks, the blacks are cheering for the lions. mandela lowers the binoculars.
MANDELA
we did that on the island, you know. we supported anyone but the `boks. it really irritated the warders.
BARBARA
of course it did. on mandela as he thinks about this for a moment, then lifts his binoculars to look at the crowd again.
CUT TO:
mandela's pov through binoculars -- on the knot of black spectators, who leap to their feet, reacting to action on the
EXT. LOFTUS VERSFELD STADIUM - DAY
-- where the lions score yet another try. this is an ass- whipping.
CUT TO:
the conversion sails over the `boks heads. the scoreboard clicks over to: lions - 20 springboks - o
INT. LOFTUS VERSFELD STADIUM VIP BOX - DAY
mandela lowers his binoculars, sets them aside, shakes his head. he knows it's hopeless now. he turns to the rugby president.
MANDELA
how long until the world cup?
RUGBY PRESIDENT
about a year.
MANDELA
plenty of time for improvement. 29. the rugby president can't take it. he stands.
RUGBY PRESIDENT
mr. president -- i wouldn't get my hopes up. we're a damn disgrace. he stomps out of the box, no doubt looking for someone to fire. mandela gets back to work.
MANDELA
i want to go to india and indonesia, too. there is a knock at the luxury box door. linga swings to face the door, alert, as a uniformed doorman opens it. the minister of sport (steve tshwete), enters.
MINISTER OF SPORT
sorry i'm late. he sits down in the empty chair to the right of mandela.
MINISTER OF SPORT
how's it going?
MANDELA
very badly. the minister of sport checks the score, winces.
MINISTER OF SPORT
maybe it's just as well. mandela shoots him a sharp look.
MANDELA
why?
MINISTER OF SPORT
(bending close, talking
QUIETLY)
i've just been at a meeting of the national sports council executive. there's strong support to drop the springbok emblem and colors altogether. (gesturing at the field) if they're playing badly, maybe its a good time to make a change. (with barely hidden
(MORE)
30. minister of sport (cont'd) this could be the last time we have to look at the green and gold. the minister of sport shoots a glance at mandela, to see his reaction to all this. mandela is deep in thought and completely unreadable.
EXT. LOFTUS VERSFELD STADIUM - DAY
one last, bloody, violent bit of play -- then, mercifully, the final whistle blows. final score: lions - 32 springboks - 15. the lions celebrate. the springboks head off the field, heads down, shoulders bowed in defeat -- none more bitterly disappointed or bloodier than francois pienaar. in the stands, the unheard of happens -- the springboks are booed by their own fans. not by everybody, but by enough. we stay with the `boks as they trudge across the field, then clatter along the concrete tunnel to their dressing room.
INT. LOFTUS VERSFELD STADIUM - SPRINGBOK DRESSING ROOM
the atmosphere is absolutely dismal as the men undress and shower. nobody catches anybody else's eye. huge, powerful, pale bodies have been ploughed purple with rake marks, bruises and roasties. plus, one dark body -- that of chester williams, a skilled wing from the cape, a reserved and private man. pienaar takes off his green and gold jersey, sits, begins taking off his cleats. his body hurts. he has been raked, scratched, bruised, and his ankle is swollen. a noble warrior, defeated.
BOLAND BOTHA (V.O.)
francois pienaar's team came to loftus versfeld stadium this afternoon, unprepared and arrogant. 31.
INT. TV STUDIO
meet boland botha as he tapes his commentary on the test match. he is an ex-springbok player from the boycott years, now turned ponderous, florid rugby commentator. he is a household name, and the last word on the state of the springboks.
BOLAND BOTHA
they left 80 minutes later with their tails between their legs, like whipped mongrels.
(BEAT)
and i, for one, am glad. not because we lost, but because there's now no way to disguise the fact that we are completely and utterly unprepared to reenter the world of top-notch international rugby. boland defines the south african talent for pessimism and negativity.
BOLAND BOTHA (ON TV)
the rugby world cup is now less than a year away, and i, for one, am relieved that we are the host nation, and therefore qualify automatically for the tournament. because i'm not sure we would get in on merit alone. the rugby president sucks on a rum and coke, watches boland with one of his henchmen.
RUGBY PRESIDENT
who gets the axe? someone has to.
INT. FRANCOIS PIENAAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
no after-match party this night. still depressed by the loss, pienaar stays home with this fiancee nerine. 32.
BOLAND BOTHA (ON TV)
pienaar's team played without discipline, without strategy and without courage.
PIENAAR
he's trying to get them to drop me.
NERINE
he's just bitter because the springboks were boycotted when he played.
PIENAAR
maybe, but people listen to what he says.
INT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
wearing pyjamas, dressing gown and slippers, mandela multi- tasks, watching boland botha and going through a pile of correspondence, scribbling notes or signing his name.
BOLAND BOTHA (ON TV)
they brought shame upon our nation, and i, for one, can say without fear of contradiction, that today, these fifteen so-called men did not deserve to wear the hallowed green and gold. on mandela: a thought, an idea -- a big one -- is churning in his head. he grunts, turns off the tv, puts the correspondence aside, stands. mary enters with a glass of milk and some pills, on a tray.
MARY
here's your muti. i warmed the milk tonight.
MANDELA
you're too good to me. mandela takes his pills.
MARY
your daughter called, to cancel her visit this weekend. 33. mandela pauses, between pills.
MANDELA
did she say why?
MARY
no, she didn't. (making it up) she said to tell you she was sorry. mandela nods, has a hard time swallowing his last pill.
MARY
do you need anything else tonight?
MANDELA
no, thank you. i'm going to bed. good night.
MARY
good night, madiba. sleep well. mandela smiles at her, but as soon as he is past her, the smile fades. as he climbs the stairs to his bedroom, his face becomes sadder and older and lonelier. in his bedroom, mandela pauses to take off his dressing gown. he looks at his bed. it is as smooth and as blank as a sheet of paper. he peels back the bedclothes at one corner, slides under them and pauses for a moment while reaching for the light switch. he switches off the light and lies down, still and straight. the most popular man in the world starts and ends each day alone.
EXT. TOWNSHIP - DAY
a very poor township outside johannesburg. a stark reminder of how much work mandela has ahead of him. a stampede of kids runs by. we follow the kids and find a small, beat-up church. a noisy line of threadbare kids leads from outside into the church. there is a pecking order in the line, based on size.
MRS. COLEMAN (O.S.)
no pushing now! there's enough for everybody! 34.
INT. SMALL, BEAT-UP CHURCH - DAY
at a table near the altar, the kids rummage through bags of second-hand clothes under the watchful eye of mrs. coleman, a stout and charitable woman. next to her, mrs. dlamini hands out a lollipop and says --
MRS. DLAMINI
god bless you. -- to each kid. the clothes and lollipops move fast, rhythm kept by mrs. dlamini's "god bless yous". the last bag of clothes empties fast as the line of kids reduces until there is only one small boy (sipho) left and only one article of clothing. an old springbok rugby practise jersey. green and gold. sipho could use it. his clothes are more holes than anything else. he looks at the springbok jersey mournfully.
MRS. COLEMAN
you're a very lucky boy. it's a real springbok practise jersey! it's a bit big, but it's warm and it'll last for ever! sipho shakes his head.
MRS. COLEMAN
it's yours, take it! go on. sipho turns and leaves. mrs. coleman looks at mrs. dlamini, completely confused.
MRS. COLEMAN
why won't he take it?
MRS. DLAMINI
if he wears it, the others will beat him up.
MRS. COLEMAN
because the springboks are playing so badly?
MRS. DLAMINI
no. because, for them, the springboks still represent apartheid.
CUT TO:

EXT. EERSTERUST CONFERENCE CENTER - DAY
eersterust is a settlement and conference location just outside pretoria. today it is the location of a full membership meeting of the national sports council, an anc organization that is now the governing body of all sports in south africa. a banner draped across the conference center entrance tells us so: welcome national sports council.
INT. CONFERENCE HALL - DAY
an nsc firebrand has the podium and the microphone.
NSC FIREBRAND
... and now for the next item on our agenda. the hall is jammed. very few white faces.
NSC FIREBRAND
the nsc executive proposes a full membership vote on the following motion ... a ripple of anticipation goes through the delegates.
NSC FIREBRAND
... that as a prominent symbol of the apartheid era, the colors, emblem and name of the springboks be eliminated immediately ... that causes a stir. the delegates understand how big this is.
NSC FIREBRAND
... and that all sports teams representing south africa shall be known forthwith as the proteas. excitement and noise level rises. the nsc firebrand has to shout through his mike.
(SHOUTING)
we will submit this motion to a hand vote.
(MORE)
36. nsc firebrand (cont'd) in the event of a close count, we will go to a written ballot. (the moment he's been
THE SPRINGBOKS, RAISE YOUR HANDS.
the nsc firebrand shoots his clenched fist into the air. with a roar, the delegates respond, raising their fists. unanimous. the springboks are history. another angle, as one of the older delegates steps outside to make a call.
INT. MANDELA'S OFFICE - DAY
at his desk, mandela puts down his phone. anger in his eyes. he slams both palms down hard on his desk.
INT. SECURITY OFFICE - DAY
both bodyguard units (minus jason) are crammed into the small office. the black bodyguards murmur amongst themselves in xhosa. (ad-lib.) the white bodyguards talk afrikaans (ad- lib). no talk between the two units, only tension. tension broken with a crash as jason slams the door open.
JASON
both units to the cars, right now.
EXT. UNION BUILDINGS, PRETORIA - DAY
grey bmw, armored grey mercedes, grey bmw in a line at the entrance. jason, kwezi, winston and sam scramble out of the building and dive into the lead bmw. etienne, hendrick, george and willem dive into the trailer. 37.
INT. UNION BUILDING HALLWAYS - DAY
brusque, scowling, mandela marches towards the exit, shadowed by linga, flanked by barbara.
BARBARA
what do i tell the japanese trade delegation?
MANDELA
i delegate that decision to you.
BARBARA
do you want me to inform the vp?
MANDELA
no.
BARBARA
we should at least include the minister of sport.
MANDELA
no. mandela heads out to the cars. barbara has no choice but to follow.
EXT. UNION BUILDINGS, PRETORIA - DAY
ever the gentleman, mandela ushers barbara into the mercedes. as she gets in:
BARBARA
i strongly advise against doing this. especially on your own. it ... it gives the impression of autocratic leadership.
INT. PRESIDENT'S MERCEDES - DAY
mandela gets in, closes the door.
BARBARA
you risk alienating your cabinet and your party.
MANDELA
your advice is duly noted, barbara. 38.
BARBARA
madiba ... the people want this. they hate the springboks. they don't want to be represented by a team they cheered against all their lives.
MANDELA
yes, i know. but in this instance the people are wrong. and it is my job as their elected leader to make them see that. mandela leans forward to talk to linga.
MANDELA
can you tell the boys that madiba wants to go to eersterust, very fast. linga murmurs into his radio. the convoy pulls out, very fast. barbara makes one last plea.
BARBARA
you're risking your political capital. you're risking your future as our leader.
MANDELA
the day i am afraid to do that is the day i am no longer fit to lead.
BARBARA
at least risk it for something more important than rugby. mandela looks out the window, says nothing, angry.
EXT. FREEWAY - DAY
mandela's convoy heads away from pretoria, very fast.
NSC FIREBRAND (V.O.)
... and in concluding this historic conference ... 39.
NSC FIREBRAND
... brothers, sisters, comrades, we in the executive applaud your diligence and courage. the nsc firebrand and the executive applaud the members. the applause spreads until the hall rocks. they are all very pleased with themselves.
EXT. EERSTERUST - CONFERENCE HALL - DAY
mandela's convoy roars in. mandela is the first one out, linga next. jason and crew scramble to cover the immediate area. kwezi opens the door for barbara on the other side. mandela strides over to jason, says something to him. jason looks surprised, turns to hendrick. linga's customary scowl intensifies.
INT. CONFERENCE HALL - DAY
as the applause finally begins to diminish, the nsc firebrand turns and nods to a church choir director, off to the side. the choir director brings his choir onto the stage.
NSC FIREBRAND
brothers, sisters ... join us in our anthem. anyone not standing, stands. the choir director raises his hands. the choir inhales. go.
(SINGING)
nkosi sikelel' iafrica etc (god bless africa) -- but before the first line is fully sung, an assistant rushes out, whispers urgently into the nsc firebrand's ear. 40. the firebrand's eyes bug out in surprise. he crosses to the choir director, says something quickly. the choir director stops the choir in mid-chorus. consternation everywhere. what's going on?
NSC FIREBRAND
brothers, sisters, members of the choir -- we would only interrupt such beautiful music for something truly important. in this case, for someone truly important. (beat, milking it) please welcome president mandela! the place goes berserk as mandela enters, with linga at his back, and -- surprise, surprise -- hendrick booyens leading the way. face stern and unsmiling, mandela walks the length of the hall towards the podium. the delegates press in towards them. another angle - jason coordinates security inside and out. lifts his radio to his mouth.
(INTO RADIO)
smile. on hendrick, as his standard bad bastard scowl suddenly becomes a smile -- which scares the throng more than the scowl did. on linga, the same. another angle - barbara enters at the back of the hall, accompanied by kwezi. mandela reaches the podium, turns looks out over the crowd, face thunderous. when they see his anger, the crowd quietens down quickly.
MANDELA
brothers, sisters, comrades, i am here because i feel strongly that you made a decision today without sufficient information or foresight. he lectures them like a headmaster. they don't like it. 41.
MANDELA
i am aware of your earlier vote. i am aware that it was unanimous.
(BEAT)
nonetheless, i propose that we restore the springboks. restore their name, their emblem and their colors, immediately. instant and complete silence in the hall. this is utterly unpopular. shocked faces, especially from the executive and the nsc firebrand. on barbara, as she sees her worst political nightmare playing out in front of her.
MANDELA
let me tell you why ... murmurs of disapproval and disagreement begin to rise. mandela's going to have to row upstream on this one.
MANDELA
... on robben island, in pollsmoor prison, my jailers were all afrikaners.
(BEAT)
for twenty seven years, i studied them. i learned their language, i read their history, i read their poetry. i had to know my enemy, in order to prevail against him.
(BEAT)
and we prevailed, did we not? all of us here ... we prevailed. for the first time, mandela says something the crowd likes.
MANDELA
our enemy is no longer the afrikaner. they are our fellow south africans, our partners in democracy. just as quickly, mandela loses them again.
MANDELA
and they treasure springbok rugby. if we take that away, we lose them. we prove that we are what they feared we would be.
(BEAT)
we have to be better than that.
(MORE)
42.
MANDELA (CONT'D)
we have to surprise them with compassion, with restraint, and generosity. the grumbling and disagreement becomes noticeably louder.
MANDELA
yes, i know. all the things they denied us. on hendrick, totally engrossed in his job, eyes sweeping across the crowd, feeling the tension.
MANDELA
but this is not the time to enjoy a moment's petty revenge. this is the time to build our nation using every single brick available to us - - even if that brick comes clothed in green and gold. the crowd is growing more restless and rebellious by the moment. linga is as alert as hendrick, tuned in to the jumpy vibe.
(ANGRY)
you elected me.
(BEAT)
you elected me to be your leader. let me lead you now.
(BEAT)
who is with me on this? it's almost as if he's daring them to go against him.
MANDELA
who is with me? the murmuring becomes a dull roar of argument and disagreement. on barbara as she closes her eyes and lowers her head: this is a fiasco.
EXT. EERSTERUST CONFERENCE CENTER - DAY
as delegates spill out of the conference hall, mandela's convoy leaves as fast as it arrived. it almost looks as if they're fleeing. 43.
INT. PRESIDENT'S MERCEDES - DAY
silence. mandela looks exhausted, almost gaunt. facing his own people like that took it out of him. barbara stares out the window, chewing her lip, totally stressed out. linga heaves a great sigh, exhales a truckload of stress.
INT. GREY BMW (LEAD CAR) - DAY
jason and his crew travel in stoic silence.
INT. GREY BMW (TRAILER) - DAY
similar silence from etienne and crew. it seems like the silence of defeat.
BARBARA
twelve votes. twelve!
MANDELA
a luxury. all we needed was one more yes than no.
BARBARA
what if you hadn't got it?
MANDELA
well, as you know, i am an obedient party member. barbara snorts disagreement. she is angry at her boss.
BARBARA
i'm sorry, madiba, but we've got problems everywhere we look. housing, food, jobs, crime, our currency. you can't keep interrupting affairs of state to placate a minority.
MANDELA
but, i must. this minority still controls the army, the police, and the economy. without them, we cannot address the other problems. 44.
BARBARA
so this rugby, it's just a political calculation? life and energy, flood back into mandela. he sits up against his seat belt, faces his chief of staff.
MANDELA
it's a human calculation.
(BEAT)
if we take away what they cherish -- the springboks, their national anthem -- we just reinforce the cycle of fear between us. on linga, in the front seat. he's not supposed to listen -- but how could he not?
MANDELA
i will do what i must to break this cycle. or it will destroy us.
INT. SPRINGBOK DRESSING ROOM - DAY
the sound of cleats approaching on concrete. exhausted footsteps. the dressing room attendant puts cases of beer (cans) on a side table, rips them open, backs away -- -- as the springboks enter silently, faces miserable, shoulders slumped. they've lost another game. one of the players grabs a beer, opens it, takes a gigantic
ANGRY SPRINGBOK
this beer tastes like kuk. -- hurls the beer against the wall so hard it ruptures, sending foaming beer everywhere. on pienaar as his eyes flash and he shoots to his feet.
PIENAAR
it's not the beer. pienaar picks up a case of beers, goes to the angry springbok. 45.
PIENAAR
take another.
(BEAT)
everybody take a beer. this is an order. the entire team takes a beer, including pienaar.
PIENAAR
a toast ... pienaar cracks his beer, raises it up. they all crack and raise their beers.
PIENAAR
... to the taste of defeat. that bewilders his team.
PIENAAR
drink it. remember it. and promise yourself never to taste it again. pienaar takes one long swig --
PIENAAR
you're right. it tastes like kuk. -- tosses his beer against the wall, so that it ruptures. eighteen other beers rupture against the wall. the dressing room is awash with beer and foam -- and re-kindled passion. as with mandela, pienaar is a leader, on a smaller scale.
INT. SECURITY OFFICE - DAY
both units crammed into the small office. as usual, neither team talks to the other. jason enters with two files.
JASON
here's the schedule for the overseas trip. jason and the boys look over one, etienne and his unit look over the other -- and discuss it amongst themselves in afrikaans. hendrick says something pointed, which resonates with the others. 46.
LINGA
what did he just say?
HENDRICK
i said --
ETIENNE
he asked when we were supposed to sleep.
HENDRICK
as well as other basic human functions.
JASON
hey. if madiba can do it, we can do it.
INT. UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY - DAY
mandela addresses the general assembly, thanking them for their support in the fight against apartheid.
MANDELA
the millions of our people say thank you, and thank you again. linga and hendrick are his closest bodyguards.
INT. WHITE HOUSE - SOUTH LAWN - DAY
mandela addresses diplomats, members of congress, black leaders at a made-for-tv ceremony on the south lawn.
MANDELA
i have come here with a message. people of the unites states of america: open your markets to us. people of the united states of american: come and invest in our country. linga, jason, etienne and hendrick are in on this one -- a little island of south africans in a sea of u.s. secret

EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
we are in a courtyard behind the palace. drawn by four white horses, a royal carriage (an open carriage) pulls up, stops. the courtyard quickly fills with liveried footmen, then security guards. queen elisabeth and mandela emerge from the palace. footmen open doors on both sides of the carriage. the queen and mandela climb in (the queen on the right hand side). when they sit down next to each other, mandela leans over and says something to the queen that makes her giggle ... ... almost. for queens do not giggle. the carriage pulls forward and these two human icons sit up straight, as they get set to face the world.
TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
... and in london, president mandela made quite an impression on the queen --
INT. PIENAAR PARENT'S HOUSE - NIGHT
on tv: footage of mandela with the queen, riding down the mall waving to ecstatic crowds.
TV ANNOUNCER
-- as he concluded a gruelling trip
TO--
mr. pienaar mutes the tv, so that he can deliver the latest one-liner to mrs. pienaar.
MR. PIENAAR
in related news, it was announced that president mandela will be visiting south africa this week. mrs. pienaar laughs. in the background, in the kitchen, a plump, middle-aged tswana woman washes the dishes and keeps an eye on the tv. this is eunice, the pienaar's maid. 48. she does not find mr. pienaar's joke amusing.
EXT. JOHANNESBURG AIRPORT - NIGHT
the president's jet taxis towards the familiar bmw, mercedes, bmw convoy.
CUT TO:
mandela disembarks, very slowly. he is exhausted, his feet are swollen, his knee hurts. this is a very different man than the one we have just seen wooing the world. he is met at the bottom of the stairs by hendrick.
HENDRICK
it's good to be home, sir. mandela just nods. too tired to talk. hendrick escorts mandela to the mercedes, opens the door for him. mandela takes a step towards the open door -- and staggers. reflexively, hendrick reaches out, steadies him.
MANDELA
i'm fine. mandela steps out of hendrick's hands, holds onto the open door.
MANDELA
travelling the world, begging for money, is very tiring. mandela reaches into his jacket, pulls a small package out, hands it to hendrick.
MANDELA
this is for you. mandela slides into the car. once the door is closed, hendrick glances at the package. we don't see it. it is too dark. but we do see that hendrick is amazed by it.
CUT TO:
49.
INT. GREY BMW - NIGHT
hendrick is being driven home through the highveld night. he chews on something really sticky, chewy. he pauses to dislodge some of it from a tooth, before it pulls out a filling. then, he resumes chewing.
INT. MANDELA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
on the bedside table, the clock clicks from 4:59 to 5:00. mandela's eyes open in the dark ... close for a second ... then shoot open again. it takes everything mandela has to sit up and switch on the light.
EXT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
the bodyguards' bmw's flank the gate. as the gate opens -- -- linga gets out of one bmw, hendrick gets out of the other. they are alert. it is freezing cold. bundled up against the cold, mandela emerges through the gate and they close in on him. it is clear that he is pushing himself, physically.
GREETING)
i see you, father.
MANDELA
morning boys.
HENDRICK
morning, sir. they keep moving. it is too cold for anything else.
MANDELA
how is your family, hendrick? 50.
HENDRICK
top shape, sir. how about yours? mandela's smile becomes fixed on his face.
MANDELA
i have a very big family. 42 million people. then, he stops, turns, heads back towards the house.
MANDELA
i don't think i want to walk today. hendrick realizes that he blundered, somehow. he shoots an anxious glance at linga -- who looks at him as if he'd just committed blasphemy. mandela goes through the open gate without a word. the gate closes behind him, leaving linga and hendrick to watch him through iron bars. linga turns on hendrick.
LINGA
we never ask him about his family.
HENDRICK
but he asks about ours all the time.
LINGA
think about it, man. he's separated from his wife. his children ... how often do you see them here?
(BEAT)
he's not a saint, okay. he's a man, with a man's problems -- and he doesn't need us reminding him about them. linga heads back to his bmw. hendrick stands at the gate, looking in at the house.
INT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - DAWN
mandela shaves, avoiding his own gaze.
CUT TO:
51. shaved, showered and dressed, mandela descends the stairs, sits down to breakfast by himself at the big table. he looks at the newspaper headlines, which talk about crime rising, the rand falling, the mandela honeymoon over etc. etc. like any other man, mandela turns to the sports section for relief -- and finally finds something to smile about.
STAYS ON AS CAPTAIN.
there is a picture of pienaar. mandela reacts to it, pleased.
INT. MANDELA'S OFFICE - DAY
as a cabinet minister and her entourage leave, barbara enters, holding an envelope.
MANDELA
hello barbara. i like that dress.
BARBARA
thank you madiba.
(OFFERING ENVELOPE)
this is for you.
(TAKING ENVELOPE)
what is it?
BARBARA
your pay checks. you haven't been collecting them. mandela opens the envelope, looks at a check -- and grunts.
BARBARA
what's wrong?
MANDELA
this is terrible.
BARBARA
madiba, it's what de klerk got. plus an increase for inflation. but, mandela shakes his head, outraged. 52.
TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
today, president mandela announced that, in his opinion --
TV ANNOUNCER
(on tv throughout) -- his salary is too high. pienaar and nerine watch the news with mr. and mrs pienaar.
MR. PIENAAR
dead right. they're all overpaid. in the background, once again, eunice washes the dishes and keeps an eye on the tv.
TV ANNOUNCER
he has therefore decided to donate a third of his monthly income to charity.
MR. PIENAAR
give me the houses and cars they give him and i'll donate a third of my salary too. francois' cell phone rings.
PIENAAR
(to mr. pienaar) you would not. not in a million years.
(ANSWERING PHONE)
hallo, pienaar. whatever pienaar hears on the phone sends him out of the room in a hurry.
(INTO PHONE)
hang on a moment, please.
TV ANNOUNCER
president mandela said that he wished to set an example to other leaders and cabinet ministers. 53.
MR. PIENAAR
fat chance. they're lining their pockets as fast as they can. nerine is interested in the call that sent pienaar hurrying out of the room. mr. pienaar mutes the tv.
MR. PIENAAR
must be his girlfriend, hey nerine.
NERINE
he knows i'd bloody kill him. on eunice, as eyes and ears alive, she finishes in the kitchen. pienaar comes back, stands in the doorway, a stunned expression on his face.
NERINE
what? who was it? pienaar doesn't answer immediately.
MR. PIENAAR
told you. it was his girlfriend.
MRS. PIENAAR
shush!
PIENAAR
i've been invited to tea.
NERINE
who with?
PIENAAR
the president.
MR. PIENAAR
the president of sa rugby? count your fingers after he shakes your hand. pienaar points at the muted tv.
PIENAAR
the president. on the tv: footage of mandela with a group of saudi princes. eunice turns and looks at francois, wide-eyed. 54. the pienaar family all stare at the tv, stunned.
PIENAAR
he wants me over for tea, week after next. eunice picks up her handbag, puts on her coat and heads for the door, stops when she reaches pienaar.
EUNICE
mr. francois -- you must tell madiba that the bus service is very bad, and too expensive. he must please fix it.
(LEAVING)
good night everybody.
MRS. PIENAAR
good night eunice, thank you. all eyes on pienaar.
MR. PIENAAR
what the hell does he want with you? pienaar shakes his head -- he has no idea.
EXT. UNION BUILDINGS, PRETORIA - DAY
nerine's modest little car heads towards the seat of power.
INT. NERINE'S CAR - DAY
nerine drives. pienaar wears a blue blazer, grey slacks and subdued tie -- and is surprisingly nervous.
NERINE
francois, relax. you've met him before.
PIENAAR
i shook his hand on the rugby field, that's all.
NERINE
you didn't even vote for him. 55.
PIENAAR
he's still the president.
(CONFESSING)
he's had dinner with the queen. with presidents and movie stars. all i do is play rugby. what if i pull something stupid in front of him? nerine stops to let pienaar out. gives him a kiss, straightens his hair.
NERINE
you won't. i'll pick you up right here.
EXT. UNION BUILDINGS, PRETORIA - DAY
pienaar climbs out of nerine's car. a pretty sizeable knot of journalists rush towards him. pienaar takes a deep breath. he is a bundle of nerves.
INT. SECURITY OFFICE - DAY
small office packed with big men.
ETIENNE
see who's coming for tea?
HENDRICK
my nephew wants me to get his autograph.
LINGA
who?
ETIENNE
francois pienaar.
JASON
who wants to escort him in? hendrick bolts for the door.
HENDRICK
i will. 56.
JASON
no autographs.
(INSULTED)
i know how to do my job, okay. hendrick leaves.
LINGA
who's this pienaar?
ETIENNE
you can't be serious? he's the captain of the springboks. linga shrugs, provocatively indifferent.
LINGA
i like soccer, myself.
ETIENNE
well, you know what they say about soccer -- it's gentleman's game played by hooligans. one the other hand, rugby is a hooligan's game played by --
LINGA
ja, ja, i've heard it before. it wasn't funny the first time. not exactly violin music and roses ... but they are talking to each other.
INT. UNION BUILDING HALLWAYS - DAY
hendrick escorts pienaar back towards mandela's offices. hendrick is the bigger man.
PIENAAR
can i ask you a question, lieutenant?
HENDRICK
ja, of course.
PIENAAR
what's he like? they pause at the office door. hendrick ponders that question for a moment, then: 57.
HENDRICK
when i worked for the previous president, it was my job to be invisible. hendrick opens the door.
HENDRICK
this president ... he found out i like english toffee and brought me some back, from his visit to the queen. hendrick ushers pienaar into mandela's offices.
HENDRICK
to him, nobody is invisible.
INT. MANDELA'S OFFICES - DAY
hendrick gestures to the waiting area.
HENDRICK
that's where you wait. one of his assistants will come for you.
(POINTING)
there's a bathroom over there, if you need it.
PIENAAR
okay. thanks. hendrick turns to leave, hesitates, turns back.
HENDRICK
what are our chances in the world cup? i mean, for real.
PIENAAR
we'll do our best. that, i can guarantee. hendrick nods solemnly, heads back to security. pienaar heads straight for the bathroom.
INT. SECURITY OFFICE - DAY
hendrick enters. etienne and the other white bodyguards look up. 58.
HENDRICK
well, he's not as big as he looks on tv.
(BEAT)
and we don't stand a bloody chance in the world cup.
INT. UNION BUILDING BATHROOM - DAY
pienaar washes his hands, dries them, dries them again, combs his hair, looks at himself in the mirror, adjusts his blazer.
INT. MANDELA'S OFFICES - DAY
pienaar returns to the waiting area, sits. there is a clock on the wall. one minute to four. four japanese trade officials traipse out, having just met mandela. the second hand journeys up to vertical. when it hits 4 o'clock exactly -- -- mary walks into the waiting area.
MARY
mr. pienaar? pienaar shoots to his feet.
MARY
this way, please. mary leads pienaar back to mandela's own office, knocks, opens the door.
MARY
go on in. mouth dry, pienaar nods -- -- and enters the inner sanctum.
INT. MANDELA'S OFFICE - DAY
mandela leaps up from behind his desk, crosses the room to meet pienaar. 59.
MANDELA
francois, what an honor. i'm so excited. they shake hands.
MANDELA
thank you for coming all this way to see me. pienaar gulps like a fish out of water.
PIENAAR
yes, sir. no problem. thank you for inviting me.
MANDELA
tell me. how's your ankle?
PIENAAR
my ankle?
MANDELA
i was told you'd hurt it. has it healed? pienaar relaxes, visibly. this is small talk he can handle. this is mandela's gift.
PIENAAR
the truth is, sir, you never play at a hundred percent, no matter what.
MANDELA
yes ... yes. in sports, and in life. come. sit. please. (indicating a chair) take this one. looking into the light hurts my eyes. they sit in the chairs. a knock at the door, and mrs. brits the old afrikaner tea lady enters, carrying a laden tea tray. mandela stands again, immediately.
MANDELA
ah, mrs. brits -- pienaar stands just a beat slower. 60.
MANDELA
-- you are a shining light in my day.
MRS. BRITS
yes sir. eyes twinkling, mrs. brits puts the tea tray down on the coffee table in front of them. the finest china, cookies on a plate.
MANDELA
mrs. brits, this is francois pienaar. he's the captain of the springboks. mandela clearly expects pienaar to shake hands with mrs. brits. pienaar holds out his hand --
(AFRIKAANS GREETING)
aangename kennis, mevrou brits. -- gently shakes hers.
MRS. BRITS
ek ook, meneer.
(TO MANDELA)
shall i pour, sir?
MANDELA
no thank you, i think i'd like to. mrs. brits leaves. mandela does not sit until the door closes behind her. pienaar only sits after he does. mandela's manners would not be out of place in victorian england.
MANDELA
how do you take your tea, francois?
PIENAAR
milk and sugar, please. mandela pours tea for both of them. on pienaar, as, just for a moment, he realizes that here he is, with the president pouring him a cup of tea. 61.
MANDELA
the english have given us many things, including rugby, but afternoon tea is one of the greatest. mandela hands pienaar the tea cup.
PIENAAR
thank you, sir. both men have big hands. fine china dwarfed and threatened. in the exact moment that both their hands hold the same saucer, mandela looks pienaar in the eye.
MANDELA
you have a very difficult job.
PIENAAR
i do? i sell gas braais. mandela lets go and pienaar takes the tea.
MANDELA
captain of the springboks. a very difficult job.
PIENAAR
not compared to yours, sir.
MANDELA
ah, but then nobody is trying to tear my head off while i'm doing mine. pienaar grins. true.
MANDELA
it is not so difficult to get people to do their best. and i imagine that anybody who plays for their country does their best, almost automatically.
PIENAAR
or they wouldn't be chosen in the first place.
MANDELA
yes. but to get people to be better than that?
(MORE)
62.
MANDELA (CONT'D)
better than they think they can be? now, that is difficult, i find.
PIENAAR
yes sir, it is.
MANDELA
how do we do that? by example? to an extent. but there is more to it than that ... (searching for the right
WORD)
... inspiration, perhaps. pienaar is engrossed. this is a master lesson on leadership, from a master.
MANDELA
how do we inspire ourselves to greatness, when nothing less will do? how do we inspire everyone around us?
(BEAT)
sometimes, i think, by using the work of others. long pause. pienaar knows to keep quiet.
MANDELA
on robben island, when things were very hard, i found inspiration in a poem.
PIENAAR
a poem?
MANDELA
a victorian poem. just words. but they helped me to stand when all i wanted was to lie down --
(SUDDENLY DISMISSIVE)
but you didn't come all this way to hear an old man talk about things that make no sense.
PIENAAR
no! they make a lot of sense, sir.
(BEAT)
on the day of a big match, say a test, in the bus on the way to the stadium, nobody talks. 63.
MANDELA
yes ... yes. everybody is preparing.
PIENAAR
when i think we're ready, i have the bus driver put on a song i've chosen; a theme song. one we all know. we listen together and ... it helps.
MANDELA
yes! i remember when i was a guest at the 1992 olympic games in barcelona. the whole stadium welcomed me with a song.
(BEAT)
at the time the future -- our future -- seemed very bleak. but to hear that song, in voices from all over our planet ... it made me very proud to be south african. it helped me to come home and do better. it allowed me to expect more of myself. a beat.
PIENAAR
may i ask what the song was, sir?
MANDELA
well, it was nkosi sikelel' iafrika. a very inspiring song. mandela looks into pienaar's eyes.
MANDELA
we need inspiration, francois. brown african eyes, blue african eyes meet over their cups of tea.
MANDELA
because, in order to build our nation, we all need to exceed our own expectations. something passes between them. whatever it is has a profound impact on pienaar. 64.
PIENAAR
yes, sir. we probably do.
CUT TO:
cameras click and whirr as mandela and pienaar shake hands for the press. (note that there are no flashes.)
INT. UNION BUILDING HALLWAYS - DAY
pienaar walks away from the president's offices, still processing his meeting with mandela. he seems a little stunned and mystified. something profound just happened -- but he's not quite sure what.
EXT. UNION BUILDINGS, PRETORIA - DAY
when pienaar steps outside and sees all of pretoria -- all of south africa -- stretching away below him, he pauses. he looks at his country in a new way. a beep beep from nerine's car interrupts his reverie, as she pulls up at the bottom of the stairs.
INT. NERINE'S CAR - DAY
nerine drives pienaar away. pienaar turns, looks back at the union buildings.
NERINE
so ...?
PIENAAR
hm?
NERINE
what's he like?
PIENAAR
he's ...
(BEAT)
... he's not like anyone i've ever met before. an unsatisfying answer. nerine waits for more. but, she isn't going to get it without prying it out of pienaar. 65.
NERINE
well? what did he want? this is the question pienaar is wrestling with, too. he thinks it over for long enough to drive nerine crazy.
NERINE
ag, come on francois. it's like talking to a bloody brick wall. what did he want? pienaar turns in his seat, looks at her as realization comes clear in him ...
PIENAAR
i think ...
(BEAT)
i think he wants us to win the world cup.
A FRAMED PHOTO OF MANDELA SQUARING OFF AGAINST MUHAMMAD ALI
looks down -- -- on mandela, who is surrounded by his grandchildren in the living room. mandela likes the babies. their parents, shoo and shepherd the kids, keeping them on their best behavior -- -- for the photographers shooting this family gathering. seeing the photographers makes this feel staged. mandela looks past the photographers, sees his daughter zindzi glancing in from the doorway, and then moving on.
MANDELA
excuse me. mandela disentangles the babies, stands, leaves.
CUT TO:
in the dining room, zindzi looks down at a big front page
PHOTO OF MANDELA AND PIENAAR SHAKING HANDS.
she is a modern, cosmopolitan young woman. when mandela enters, zindzi looks up from the newspaper with a very mandela-like grunt. 66.
MANDELA
what do you think?
ZINDZI
it doesn't matter what i think.
MANDELA
yes, it does.
(DEFIANT)
okay. i think he looks like one of the policemen who forced us out of our house when you were in jail. i don't like seeing you shake his hand. and i'm not the only one. mandela overreacts.
MANDELA
you criticize without understanding. you seek only to address your own feelings. this is selfish thinking. it does not serve the nation. zindzi shakes her head, turns, leaves.
MANDELA
wait. please. i -- mandela wants to apologize, doesn't know how. instead, he pulls an envelope out of his pocket, holds it out.
MANDELA
will you give this to your mother.
ZINDZI
what is it?
MANDELA
a bracelet. zindzi looks into the envelope. in it is the beaded bracelet, from earlier, from the bathroom.
ZINDZI
just throw it away.
MANDELA
i don't have the right to. it's not mine. 67.
ZINDZI
if she left it here, she meant to throw it away. only children know how to twist the dagger so deftly. mandela turns away so that his daughter cannot see his eyes. a man so at ease with strangers does not know how to talk to his own family.
INT. PIENAAR PARENT'S HOUSE - DAY
the same newspaper photo of mandela and pienaar that zindzi was looking at -- only, this time, someone is cutting it out, very carefully. eunice. mr. pienaar enters to get something from the fridge, sees what eunice is doing. eunice stops cutting. mr. pienaar looks down at the photo for a long moment. he doesn't know how to react to it.
EUNICE
mrs. pienaar said you were finished with the paper.
MR. PIENAAR
ja. of course. mr. pienaar leaves. eunice keeps cutting until the photo can be lifted up. she nods, proud.
EXT. SPRINGBOK TRAINING FACILITY - DAY
on a practise field at this world-class facility, the springbok squad (about 30 guys) sprint to the 25 m line, drops, begins 20 explosive push-ups. note, also, that at least half of the players who faced the british lions earlier are gone.) 68.
MINISTER OF SPORT (V.O.)
the world cup is played every four years. sixteen teams qualify from around the world.
INT. MANDELA'S OFFICE - DAY
the minister of sports briefs mandela on the world cup, with the help of a big diagram on an easel (just like a march madness bracket layout, showing all the teams.) the minister looks ragged, exhausted.
MINISTER OF SPORT
four pools of four teams each, playing in nine different venues around the country. two teams will advance from each pool to the quarter finals. mandela studies the diagram. he loves this stuff.
MANDELA
the ivory coast qualified. this is wonderful. (for the record, the sixteen teams who qualified were: south africa, new zealand, australia, england, scotland, ireland, wales, canada, romania, italy, france, japan, west samoa, argentina, tonga and ivory coast.)
EXT. SPRINGBOK TRAINING FACILITY - DAY
the springbok squad leap up after the push-ups, sprint to the 50 m line, drop, begin 20 rapid crunches -- -- under the critical eye of the new coach and manager.
MINISTER OF SPORT
australia won the previous world cup. new zealand won the one before that.
(MORE)
69. minister of sport (cont'd) they're both clear favorites to reach the finals this time.
(BEAT)
according to the experts, we'll reach the quarter finals, and no further.
MANDELA
according to the experts, you and i are still supposed to be in jail. that brings a grin from the minister of sport.
EXT. SPRINGBOK TRAINING FACILITY - DAY
the coach blows his whistle.
COACH
again! on pienaar, as he leaps to his feet, leads the charge back to the 25 m line.
MINISTER OF SPORT
you make a personal appearance at the finals, and at the opening match between the springboks and australia.
(BEAT)
the finals will be broadcast to over a billion people around the world, live.
MANDELA
a billion people watching us! (wheels turning in his

yes ... yes. this is a great opportunity.

EXT. SPRINGBOK TRAINING FACILITY - DAY
hands on their knees, sucking air, retching, the squad has worked their way down the full length of the field.
SPRINGBOK MANAGER
i reckon you've knocked the stuffing out of them today.
COACH
i haven't even begun.
(BEAT)
we may not be the most talented team in the world -- but we're going to be the fittest. he blows his whistle.
COACH
and back! the squad can't believe their ears. no one moves. except pienaar.
PIENAAR
come on boys, let's show him. staggering more than sprinting, pienaar heads towards the 25m line.
SPRINGBOK FLANK
shit, what's pienaar been eating? but, they follow him.
INT. MANDELA'S OFFICE - DAY
alone in his office, mandela looks at the world cup diagram, for a moment, then picks up his phone.

please call the head of south african rugby for me.
CUT TO:

INT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY
thirty completely wiped-out athletes. some are too tired to shower, some have made it that far, but are too tired to change. pienaar has showered and changed and slumps next to his locker. the springbok manager enters, followed by the rugby
PRESIDENT.
pienaar and the boys drag themselves upright. the rugby president looks them over as if they were his very own stable of race horses -- a stable he's not entirely sure he likes.
RUGBY PRESIDENT
afternoon men. it's good to see you working so hard. i have a short announcement.
(BEAT)
as part of the pr buildup to the world cup, you will be conducting coaching clinics in townships all over the country. the players greet this announcement with complete silence.
RUGBY PRESIDENT
i know you have plenty on your plates already -- but this is a request that comes from the top. (looking at pienaar,
POINTEDLY)
the very top. the rugby president turns on his heel, and leaves, followed by the manager. the players say nothing for a long moment, but body language alone shows that they are completely disgusted.
SPRINGBOK HOOKER
this is complete crap.
SPRINGBOK FLANK
are we some kind of circus act now? 72.
SPRINGBOK LOCK
we don't have time for kuk like this. the boys are getting angrier by the second.
SPRINGBOK LOCK
they expect us to play our best, to give our bloody all, then they add to our bloody workload ... the lock turns to chester.
SPRINGBOK LOCK
what do you think about this, chester? all eyes on chester, as if the poor guy is a magic guide to a world they barely understand.
CHESTER WILLIAMS
i try not to think. it interferes with my rugby. the perfect answer for these guys.
SPRINGBOK LOCK
see! now there's a rugby player. talk to them francois.
SPRINGBOK WING
make them see that this is a waste of time we don't have. all eyes on their captain -- who shakes his head, no.
PIENAAR
i'm not going to talk to them.
SPRINGBOK FLANK
why not?
PIENAAR
whether we like it or not, we're more than just a rugby team. we're ... we're ambassadors inside our own country. and we might as well get used to it. silence. rebellious silence. then:
SPRINGBOK LOCK
is this you speaking, or mandela? 73. pienaar's eyes are fierce. he needs them to see how serious he is.
PIENAAR
you know me better than that.
(BEAT)
times change. we need to change, too. it is clear that much of his team disagrees with him.
INT. MANDELA'S OFFICES - NIGHT
close-up on a tv -- horrible, startling images of the
TV ANNOUNCER (ON TV)
we're looking at the remains of the federal building in oklahoma city, america, which was destroyed today in a massive explosion. pull back to reveal that we are in mandela's offices. barbara, mary, other assistants look on. so do the bodyguards. all faces stunned, appalled. mandela approaches slowly from his office, drawn in by the horrible, irresistible images. he stands behind his people.
TV ANNOUNCER
no one has claimed responsibility yet, but authorities say that the timing and target mark this as the work of white, right-wing fanatics. an act of revenge for the fbi killings in waco, texas. jason and linga share a pointed look. south africa is a global leader in white, right-wing fanatics.
TV ANNOUNCER
the explosive, a truck bomb, was apparently a simple mixture of commonly available industrial and agricultural materials.
(TO LINGA)
that's all we need.
(MORE)
74.
JASON (CONT'D)
a homemade explosive from materials every boer already has. then, jason realizes that mandela is standing right next to him.
TV ANNOUNCER
so far, the official death toll stands at over a 100 people, which includes at least 12 children from a day care center in the federal building. mandela turns to barbara.
MANDELA
please call president clinton for me. i wish to offer him our condolences. mandela turns to jason, eyes deep and dark.
MANDELA
do you see why forgiveness is essential, jason?
(BEAT)
revenge only begets revenge. as mandela walks back to his office, there is a look of utter sorrow on his face.
EXT. FREEWAY - DAY
a luxury bus heads along the freeway.
INT. LUXURY BUS - DAY
the springbok squad rides in style. most are wearing tracksuits, most are asleep. pienaar is awake.
EXT. TOWNSHIP - DAY
the same township where sipho rejected the springbok rugby jersey. at one edge we find what passes for a soccer field. just a littered rectangular expanse of highveld winter dirt. 75. tv vans and a very nervous springbok management crew drive to the edge of the field, stop, get out -- -- and are immediately mobbed by threadbare, excited kids, many of them begging for cash and candy. sipho in the thick of things. one of the springbok management crew pulls a rolled banner on two spiked poles out of their van. mallet and banner in hand, the management crew head to the edge of the field, mobbed by shouting, whistling township kids. they hammer one pole into the ground, unroll the banner (seen from the back so that we can't read the words), get set to hammer the second pole into the ground -- -- except that there is a smashed beer bottle in the way. broken glass everywhere. they look at the broken glass, then turn and look across the field. broken glass glints in the low sun, all over the field.
SPRINGBOK MANAGEMENT CREW#1
they can't play on this.
SPRINGBOK MANAGEMENT CREW#2
when are they due?
SPRINGBOK MANAGEMENT CREW#1
fifteen minutes.
SPRINGBOK MANAGEMENT CREW#2
plenty of time. he reaches into his wallet, pulls out a r100 note (about $17), holds it up high. the kids yell for it.
MOST GLASS!
mayhem, as kids sprint out across the field, hunting for glass. sipho goes for the tiniest, most treacherous shards.
CUT TO:
76.
INT. LUXURY BUS - DAY
the bus hits a rut in the dirt road with an almighty jolt, which wakes the sleeping springboks. they look out of the windows and see the absolutely hellish outskirts of the township. every possible incarnation of poverty, as far as the eye can see. this shocks them. most of them have never been anywhere like this township.
SPRINGBOK LOCK
shit, i'm glad i don't live here.
EXT. TOWNSHIP - DAY
the driver sounds the horn, as they pull into the township.
INT. LUXURY BUS - DAY
the bus pulls up at the field --
EXT. TOWNSHIP - DAY
-- which is covered with kids on their hands and knees.
SPRINGBOK HOOKER
what the hell are they doing? the driver sounds the horn again, and the kids on the field sprint for the bus, hands and pockets full of broken glass.
PIENAAR
don't forget, we've got tv cameras on us at all times.
(MUTTERING)
what a bloody joke.
EXT. TOWNSHIP - DAY
as the kids approach the bus, they dump their broken glass under the banner, which reads -- 77.
ONE TEAM, ONE COUNTRY
-- brown, green, white, blue shards tinkling and piling up, like lethal jewels, backlit in the low winter sun. one of the big kids gets the r100. attention focussed on
THAT --
-- until the bus door opens with a loud hiss of hydraulics and the springboks exit, one by one. pienaar first, with a huge net bag of practise balls over his shoulder. the springboks are all so big, so strong, so healthy, they look like gods, or aliens, emerging from a spaceship. the kids go quiet, awed and uncomfortable. until chester williams steps off the bus, and there is a collective sigh of recognition and wonder. now, the kids can relate to the springboks. even sipho, who looks on from the side of the field. springbok management notes it. the tv crews note it. pienaar notes it.
PIENAAR
okay chester -- i reckon you're up.
(PANICKING)
what am i supposed to do?
PIENAAR
what you do best. pienaar turns to the throng.
WHO WANTS TO PLAY RUGBY?
a roar. they all do. pienaar opens the net bag full of rugby balls, gives a ball to chester.
PIENAAR
let rip. 78. chester boots the ball out over the crowd, high and incredibly far in the thin winter air. (60 yards, easily.) pienaar tosses balls to the others.
PIENAAR
let's do our best. one after another, the springboks kick the balls high into the air.
PIENAAR
go get them! the kids go after them. sipho stays on the sideline.
BEGIN RUGBY CLINIC MONTAGE
barely controlled chaos. each springbok works with one ball and a group of kids. there are three themes to this montage. first, a primer on the basic rules of rugby, with demonstrations.
SPRINGBOK HOOKER
who here knows the first rule of rugby?
TOWNSHIP KID
me!
SPRINGBOK HOOKER
what is it?
TOWNSHIP KID
only hit the other players when the ref isn't looking! laughter. a good ice-breaker.
PIENAAR
no. the first rule of rugby is you can only pass the ball backwards or sideways. pienaar demonstrates. (note: all the rules are demonstrated.)
VARIOUS SPRINGBOKS
- if you drop the ball, or pass it forwards, you scrum for possession. - this is a scrum. - you kick forwards.
(MORE)
79. various springboks (cont'd) if you kick it out of bounds, you throw it back in to a lineout. - this is a lineout. - you score in four ways: a try, when you dot the ball down behind the try line. that's five points. - another two points when you convert the try by kicking the ball through the uprights. - three points for a penalty kick. - three points for a drop kick. - have you got all that?
KIDS
no!
SPRINGBOK HOOKER
agh, bugger it, let's just run and pass. whoever drops the ball does pushups! second, as the players work with the kids, they get into it. much to their own surprise, they enjoy the energy, they enjoy the kids, they enjoy the giving. even the grumpiest, most conservative springbok.
SPRINGBOK LOCK
okay. who wants to scrum against me? one huge man scrums against a horde of kids. he pushes them backwards with a roar -- then lets them push him backwards. they love it, the cameras love it. the third theme shows the emergence of chester williams as the face of the springboks. the crowd of kids around him is twice as big as any other player's crew. given chester's basically shy nature, he finds it all a bit overwhelming. the tv cameras follow him even more closely than they follow pienaar. at one point, an errant pass puts a rugby ball right at sipho's feet. he hesitates, then picks it up. he doesn't just hold it, he feels it. end the montage as the luxury bus pulls away, surrounded by a horde of cheering kids, many of whom hold new rugby balls under their arms. one blast on the horn, one answering cheer from the kids and the bus slowly accelerates away.

INT. UNION BUILDING CONFERENCE ROOM - EVENING
a cabinet meeting in the rainbow nation, with mandela at the head of the table. the minister of the environment is making a presentation about a campaign to put an end to littering by plastic bags. behind him is a very dramatic slide image of a rural barbed wire fence festooned with wind-blown plastic bags.
MINISTER OF THE ENVIRONMENT
-- and in addition to the nationwide pr campaign, we propose that all retail outlets charge a nominal fee for plastic bags -- mary enters quietly, slips a piece of paper in front of mandela, who reads it, holds up his hand.
MANDELA
mr. minister, please forgive me. this sounds excellent, and we will return to it, but if you'll indulge me for just one minute -- mandela nods to mary, who switches on a big tv on the wall -- which shows news footage of the coaching clinic in the township. when we see the footage of the lock scrumming with the kids, mandela laughs, delighted, turns to his cabinet.
MANDELA
you see, that picture is worth any number of speeches.
INT. PIENAAR PARENT'S HOUSE - NIGHT

around the world -- objectively -- what are they saying about our chances against australia?
MINISTER OF SPORT
everyone thinks they'll beat us. and if they do, we'll have to go through england and the all blacks just to get to the final.
MANDELA
so it is very important that we beat australia. (to minister of sport) thank you. 83. the minister leaves. alone in his office, mandela sits, thinks, gets a sheet of paper with his personal letterhead on it, uncaps his fountain pen. over mandela's shoulder, we see him write, and then underline, the title invictus by w.e. henley. barbara knocks, pokes her head in.
BARBARA
the cabinet ministers are here to brief you on the trip to taiwan.
MANDELA
i'll be right out. from memory, mandela writes the first line of the poem: out of the night that covers me ...
EXT. NEWLANDS - DAY
the luxury bus comes around a bend in a leafy suburb of cape town, right under the flanks of table mountain. ahead, we see newlands stadium, home of the world cup opener between the springboks and australia. a magnificent old stadium in a beautiful setting.
INT. LUXURY BUS - DAY
all eyes on the stadium as the bus idles past, very slowly. this is a coach move.
COACH
one week, boys. excited faces become grave, serious. the bus goes quiet. coach nods to himself, pleased.
EXT. NEWLANDS STADIUM - DAY
the bus pulls away. 84. we stay at newlands stadium -- and swoop upwards until we are looking down on the stadium and surrounding streets. this aerial shot becomes a big map --
INT. NEWLANDS STADIUM - SECURITY CENTER - DAY
-- pinned to a board in the security center.
JASON
we need snipers on top of the stadium and these surrounding buildings. jason leads the meeting. he uses an old-fashioned pointer. all of mandela's security detail present, plus local cop
LOCAL COP
not a problem.
JASON
we want these two approaches completely sanitized.
LOCAL COP
two approaches?
JASON
we're not going to decide which way we bring him in until the very last moment.
(BEAT)
we need uniforms, plain clothes, sharp-shooters ...
LINGA
and sniffer dogs.
JASON
yes. no truck bombs, no oklahoma city. the locals stir, share a look. this is going to be a nightmare.
JASON
we've got an army unit on standby at silvermine, if you need more men. not an option the cops favor, judging by their faces. 85.
JASON
we're not taking any chances, okay. the president's going to be very exposed.
(BEAT)
much too exposed.
INT. PRESIDENT'S MERCEDES - DAY
the silver mercedes tools into cape town past groote schuur. mandela travels with barbara, who opens her first file of the journey -- but is forestalled by her boss.
MANDELA
barbara, i have been studying.
BARBARA
for the summit in taiwan? good.
MANDELA
no. not exactly. mandela hands barbara a folded sports section.
MANDELA
test me. barbara unfolds the sports section -- -- to reveal color photographs of the springbok squad. a collector's pull-out. barbara looks at the photos, shakes her head.
BARBARA
they look like thugs. mandela just smiles at that remark.
MANDELA
block out the names. see if i can recognize them. barbara gives her boss a put-upon look -- this is such a waste of time! -- but blocks out the first row of names. mandela points at the first photo.
MANDELA
andre joubert.
(MORE)
86.
MANDELA (CONT'D)
gavin johnson.
(BEAT)
did i get them right?
BARBARA
yes, madiba.
MANDELA
(immensely pleased with
HIMSELF)
this is how i used to study in law school. (next photo is of chester) unfortunately, chester is far too easy to identify. but that will change. it must.
EXT. CAPE TOWN STREETS - EVENING
the entire springbok squad has been on a training run through cape town, on ordinary streets, through ordinary people. (this is unthinkable in top-level sports anywhere else. it really happened.) when they are recognized, drivers toot their horns, pedestrians cheer, kids on bicycles ride with them (mostly still white). as they approach the hotel grounds, pienaar surges to the front, so that he can give them a message as they pass through the hotel gate.
PIENAAR
players-only meeting in the team room after dinner.
INT. SPRINGBOK TEAM ROOM - CAPE TOWN HOTEL - NIGHT
normally a conference room, now equipped with fridge, pool table, ping pong, sofas, tv etc. the entire team has assembled, minus pienaar. a quiet air. serious, relaxed. pienaar enters, holding a sheaf of xeroxed pages, begins to hand them out.
SPRINGBOK HOOKER
what's this? homework? 87.
PIENAAR
sort of. the players look down at the pages. on a page: the words to nkosi sikelel' iafrika, in xhosa. one by one, the players look from the page to pienaar.
SPRINGBOK WING
cappie? what's this?
PIENAAR
we need to learn it. we can't just mouth the words anymore.
SPRINGBOK HOOKER
nobody cares, as long as we win matches.
PIENAAR
they do care.
SPRINGBOK LOCK
it's their song, not ours.
SPRINGBOK WING
it's a terrorist song.
SPRINGBOK PROP
they used to arrest you for singing it.
PIENAAR
and now it's one of our anthems. but he's talking to a deeply conservative group of guys.
SPRINGBOK HOOKER
cap. you know i leave my guts on the field for you, and you know i'd follow you into a fight anywhere, any time. but this ... the hooker crumples the page, is about to throw it away.
SPRINGBOK HOOKER
... i can't even read it. i definitely can't pronounce the words. one look at his men, and pienaar knows he has hit a wall. 88.
PIENAAR
okay, boys. it's optional. take it if you want to. the players are relieved. pienaar looks down at the sheet of paper for a moment, then looks up at the guys.
PIENAAR
it means "god bless africa".
(BEAT)
which you have to admit, we could use. nonetheless, most of the players crumple the pages, toss them into the closest trash can.
BOLAND BOTHA
tell us, mr. president, have you always been a rugby fan? mandela appears with boland botha on his show, under a one team, one nation banner.
MANDELA
people do not realize that i once played rugby myself, when i was a student at fort hare. it is a very rough game. almost as rough as politics. boland laughs.
BEGIN BOLAND BOTHA/MANDELA INTERVIEW SEQUENCE
shots of booze being delivered to people's houses all over the country by bottle store delivery vans (a very south african alcoholic enabling service). lots and lots of booze.
BOLAND BOTHA (V.O.)
how do you think the springboks will do?
MANDELA (V.O.)
i think they will do very well. their level of commitment is tremendous. 89. the springboks train on an isolated field at the silvermine army base outside cape town. tactics and refinements, not fitness training.
BOLAND BOTHA (V.O.)
now, it's been said that you used to support any team who played against the springboks.
MANDELA (V.O.)
obviously, that is no longer true. i am one hundred percent behind our boys. jason, etienne, linga and hendrick stand anxiously outside newlands stadium. one of them points to the top of a tall building nearby -- a eureka! moment, for reasons we don't yet understand.
MANDELA
after all, if i cannot change when circumstances demand it, how can i ask others to?
EXT. CAPE TOWN - DAY
a south african defense force helicopter hovers over the tall building next to newlands stadium.
INT. SADF HELICOPTER - DAY
in the helicopter, mandela, jason, linga, all wearing radio headsets. all wearing suits, as if for a state occasion.
(ON RADIO)
we're going to land you on top of that building. we'll own the road between it and the stadium. mandela likes it. jason gives the pilot a nod and they take off down the peninsula towards silvermine army base. from the helicopter, mandela looks down at his country, and finds it good. 90.
EXT. CAPE - DAY
helicopter against spectacular scenery.
INT. SADF HELICOPTER - DAY
mandela points down. jason and linga look. pov from the air: they can see the springboks practising right below them, on the army base. mandela pulls out the sports section with the springbok team on it. his study guide. he takes a last minute glance at it as the helicopter loses altitude.
EXT. SILVERMINE ARMY BASE - RUGBY FIELDS - DAY
mandela's helicopter lands at the edge of the field, and brings practise to a halt. on coach -- not happy, but what's he going to do. mandela springs out of the helicopter, energized, excited. linga and jason with him. the players assemble in a loose, semi-formal unit. not a line, but orderly. (we may or may not notice that chester williams is missing.) pienaar stands at the front, relaxed. he's an old hand with mandela, by now.
MANDELA
francois, gentlemen -- forgive me for interrupting your work the day before such an important match ...
(BEAT)
... i just wanted to wish you good luck, in person. there is a naughty twinkle in mandela's eye.
MANDELA
and sometimes, very seldom, as president, i am allowed to do what i want. they all laugh. 91. mandela wades in amongst them, leaving linga and jason behind. picture this: behind the barbed wire security of a modern, south african military base, a tall, regal black man in his 70's is surrounded by huge, sweating, battered, brutal- looking white men --
(DOING INTRODUCTIONS)
mr. president, this is --
MANDELA
i know who this is.
(SHAKING HANDS)
good luck, andre. (shaking hands with all of
THEM)
good luck brendan, we're behind you all. japie -- etc -- every single one of whose names he has committed to memory. statesmanship is often about attention to detail. the players are awe-struck. (for the record: andre, gavin, james, japie, christiaan, brendan, hennie, joel, johan, joost, marius, james, chris, pieter, garry, mark, kobus, hannes, krynauw, ruben, francois, robby, adriaan, rudolf.) cut away to jason and linga, who are amazed by what they're seeing.
LINGA
did you ever imagine this?
JASON
how could i? by the time mandela has shaken every single player's hand, he has won the team over, coach and manager included. they glow. and then, mandela frowns, steps back, looks at all of them.
MANDELA
but where is chester? pienaar doesn't answer immediately, he looks at his coach first. coach nods. 92.
PIENAAR
he's injured, sir. his hamstring. we're trying to keep it quiet.
MANDELA
is he out for the whole tournament?
PIENAAR
with hamstrings, who knows?
(BEAT)
we'll miss him.
MANDELA
the whole country will miss him. a somewhat sour note to leave on. but it's about to be rescued.
SPRINGBOK PROP
mr. president, sir --
MANDELA
yes, hennie.
SPRINGBOK PROP
-- this is for you. from us. the huge, thick man holds out a green cap with gold piping and a springbok leaping above the visor. mandela takes the cap as if he has just been given a holy relic.
MANDELA
i am honored. truly honored. mandela runs his finger over the embroidered springbok leaping across the front of the cap.
MANDELA
good luck gentlemen. your country supports you, completely. the team applauds, beaming, glowing. mandela turns to go back to the helicopter.
MANDELA
francois, walk with me. pienaar walks mandela back towards the helicopter. 93.
MANDELA
i have something for you. mandela reaches into his jacket, pulls out an envelope with the president's letterhead on it. gives it to pienaar.
MANDELA
this helped me, many times. perhaps it will help you, too.
CUT TO:
pienaar holds the envelope, stares upwards at the rising, departing helicopter, as do the rest of the team -- until coach blows his whistle.
COACH
enough fun and games! we've still got work to do.
INT. NEWLANDS STADIUM - SECURITY CENTER - NIGHT
jason paces restlessly, going over his mental check list, making sure he hasn't missed anything.
INT. MANDELA'S CAPE TOWN HOUSE - NIGHT
mandela reads, scrawls comments, signs papers from a big "in" pile. mary enters with his glass of milk and his pills.
MARY
it's time for bed.
MANDELA
i think i'll stay up a little longer. the country is excited tonight.
MARY
you need to sleep. the doctor said.
MANDELA
the doctor has no sense of occasion. 94. mandela turns on the tv, begins flipping channels. rugby, rugby, rugby. mandela is sucked in. mary sighs.
INT. COACH'S ROOM - CAPE TOWN HOTEL - NIGHT
the coach and the manager. cats on a hot tin roof.
COACH
there's nothing more we can do. the game plan's good. it's just a matter of the boys executing it tomorrow.
MANAGER
that's pienaar's job. it's in his hands, now.
INT. PIENAAR'S ROOM - CAPE TOWN HOTEL - NIGHT
room dark but for one small desk light. pienaar stands at the window, looking out across cape town. he is deep in thought. pienaar turns away from the window, goes to the desk, where, under one small light, we see "invictus", the poem mandela wrote out by hand. pienaar begins reading it. there is a soft knock at his door. pienaar goes to it, opens it. it is nerine, accompanied by a cop. pienaar nods at the cop, steps back so that nerine can enter. as soon as the door closes behind her, nerine says:
NERINE
you know the best thing about you being the captain?
PIENAAR
uh ... the honor?
NERINE
you don't have to share a room. nerine gives pienaar a scorching kiss. he resists ... then responds -- then pulls away. 95.
(BREATHLESS)
francois, come on. it's been weeks.
PIENAAR
uh uh. i need to be angry for tomorrow. nerine takes a deep breath, nods, turns away -- and sees the poem on mandela's personal letterhead.
NERINE
what's this?
PIENAAR
a poem. from the president.
NERINE
how does a poem help you play rugby?
PIENAAR
the same way your visit does.
(BEAT)
inspiration.
EXT. NEWLANDS STADIUM - DAY
a massive crowd roars. the wallaby flyhalf runs forward, puts his boot into the ball, sends it soaring towards the waiting springboks. the springbok lock rises high into the air, supported on all sides, takes the ball out of the air perfectly -- -- just as the wallaby pack closes in and huge men meet with an adrenaline-fueled crunch of bodies. the world cup has begun at last.
CUT TO:
but not for chester williams. clad in springbok blazer and tie, he sits behind the coach, the manager and the reserves, in the stands -- and almost succeeds in hiding his utter disappointment at not being on the field. 96.
INT. NEWLANDS STADIUM - VIP BOX - DAY
mandela looks on, calmly. the minister of sport isn't late for this match. the president of rugby is pale with nerves. behind mandela, stand linga and hendrick. the vip box is a safe place, but jason isn't taking any chances.
EXT. NEWLANDS STADIUM - DAY
jason prowls through the stadium, talking constantly on his radio. hunter's adrenaline.
INT./EXT. NEWLANDS STADIUM - DAY
back to action on the field. the highlights we see here should match the rugby primer we saw in the township. this continues the education of those who do not know rugby. so, for instance, we see a ball knocked forward, and the resulting scrum. we see a ball kicked out of bounds, and the resulting lineout. we see scintillating passing, rucking, mauling, tackling, strategic kicking at it's very best. both teams are crisp and strong.
INTERCUT SHOTS OF THE RUGBY MATCH --
-- with shots of the security arrangements (snipers, lots and lots of uniformed cops inside and out, sniffer dogs etc. all overseen by jason) -- -- with shots of the crowd, which, unlike the earlier test against the lions, is completely and passionately united behind the springboks (all commentators talk about the extraordinary passion of the crowd, that day) -- -- always returning to the vip box, where something interesting is taking place right behind mandela: linga moonsamy, the rugby scorner, the soccer lover, loses his scowling reserve and gets sucked into the game. 97. when a ball soars between the uprights and everyone in the box groans, linga leans towards hendrick and asks:
LINGA
what happened?
HENDRICK
they scored. when another ball soars between the uprights and the crowd roars, linga asks again:
LINGA
what happened?
HENDRICK
we scored. a third ball through the uprights. before linga can ask:
HENDRICK
they scored again. a fourth ball, to the joy of the others in the box.
LINGA
we scored?
HENDRICK
ja. we're tied. a fifth ball through the uprights, and the crowd goes wild.
HENDRICK
we're up by three. action on the field, as a wallaby drive combining backs and forwards moves relentlessly towards the springbok try line. six times the drive is stopped by springbok tackling, but the wallabies keep possession and, on the seventh wave of the assault score a beautiful open try, which is converted. a ripple of concern goes through the crowd -- -- and the vip box.
LINGA
they're ahead?
HENDRICK
by four. nerves in the box. 98. but not on the field, as pienaar starts a drive with a tackle we feel ourselves, resulting in a change of possession -- -- and a stunning, open field try scored in the corner by the springbok wing, who raises his fist in the air, after juking the last wallaby to try and tackle him. the crowd roars. in the vip box, mandela is on his feet, shaking hands with everyone he can reach, including linga and hendrick, and the waiter. the difficult, angled conversion is missed.
LINGA
what does that mean?
HENDRICK
we're only ahead by one. another penalty kick.
HENDRICK
we're ahead by four. a drop goal.
HENDRICK
by seven. an incredible try by the springbok fly half.
HENDRICK
by fourteen. everyone dares to dream. the classic south african penchant for pessimism begins to abate. two things to note: the crowd roar grows and grows and grows and is echoed in the vip box. even jason turns to look at the action on the field -- but only for a second. also, this match serves as the coming-out party for the springbok fly half, who scores 22 of south africa's 27 points this day. suddenly, a referee's whistle creates pandemonium on the field, in the stands, and in the vip box.
LINGA
what happened?
HENDRICK
we won! 99.
LINGA
we did? mandela shoots to his feet, pushes his chair away and begins the famous "mandela shuffle" -- a very cool african boogie that is one of his signature moves. on the mandela shuffle --
INT. VIP PARTY - NIGHT
-- the same shuffle hours later, at a vip party. mandela has changed clothes, wears one of his indonesian-inspired "madiba shirts" and dances energetically with the absolutely stunning trophy wife of one of the vip's.
TROPHY WIFE
you must be very pleased!
MANDELA
what man would not be pleased to be dancing with a beautiful woman like you?
TROPHY WIFE
oh, mr. president, you're exaggerating.
MANDELA
indeed not. my father was a xhosa chief, and therefore a polygamist. as you know, i am not.
(BEAT)
but when i look at you ... i envy my father. the man is a major flirt, and really enjoying himself. but, once again, he is dancing with a stranger -- -- and, when we get close to his eyes, we realize that mandela is pushing himself way past empty.
INT. JASON'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
jason is asleep on his face, in his suit and shoes.
CUT TO:
100.
EXT. CAPE TOWN WATERFRONT - NIGHT
big party, spilling onto the streets. most of the partiers are white. black south africans look on, or serve drinks. we follow the crowd into a big sports bar --
INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT
-- where the springboks are pounding beers and blowing off the steam of months of training grind, plus a huge win. even though most of the players are with their wives or girlfriends, pretty, single women crowd them, two and three deep, men pay for round after round of beers. pienaar and nerine are part of the action. then pienaar gets a text message which makes him shake his head, give nerine a chagrined look. he grabs the springbok closest to him, puts his mouth near the player's ear and screams again the hubbub:
IT ON.
the springbok shakes his head -- bloody coach -- grabs the player next to him, repeats it. pienaar watches the message travelling through his team -- and grins. then, something catches his eye on one of the big overhead tv's. on the tv: news footage of the mandela victory boogie. the boogie is followed by a quick "how far we have come" type of montage. one of the images shows an island ringed by rough surf. pienaar gets an idea.
EXT. CAPE TOWN STREETS - DAY
pienaar leads his hung-over, sleep-deprived team on a very slow jog through the mostly empty streets. 101. when he gets to an intersection, he sneaks a peek down at the palm of his left hand. close-up on pienaar's hand, where he has drawn a crude street map. pienaar takes a left at the intersection.
CUT TO:
another intersection, another peek at the map on his hand, and another left turn, takes the team --
EXT. CAPE TOWN WATERFRONT - DAY
-- back onto the waterfront, to an idling ferry boat, where the coach and the manager wait for them -- along with the player's wives and girlfriends.
COACH
i hope you're not that slow next week. pienaar grins, stops. the team stops around him.
SPRINGBOK FLYHALF
what's going on?
PIENAAR
a change of pace.
EXT. FERRY BOAT - DAY
the ferry pulls away from the waterfront, with the team on board, pulling on tracksuits against the cold sea air. it is early winter. the seas are fairly rough. so are the stomachs of the `boks who partied hard last night.
SPRINGBOK HOOKER
who's bloody idea was this? on pienaar, innocent as a lamb. 102.
EXT. OPEN OCEAN - DAY
behind the ferry, cape town and table mountain, in all their glory. ahead of the ferry, one of the most notorious island prisons in modern history --
EXT. ROBBEN ISLAND - DAY
robben island lies only eight miles from the mainland. it is two miles long, with sandy beaches full of penguins and seals. it would be pretty -- -- but for its maximum security prison. concrete, barbed wire, guard towers. (in 1995, the political prisoner wing was shut, but the island still housed criminal prisoners, so the island still had the feel of real incarceration. today, it is a tourist destination.)
EXT. OPEN OCEAN - DAY
as they approach the island, a sense of dark history settles over the springboks and their partners. one of the springboks turns to a deckhand, getting ready to moor at the jetty.
SPRINGBOK LOCK
how do they bring the prisoners here?
DECKHAND
on this boat. sobering.
EXT. ROBBEN ISLAND - DAY
the springboks and their partners step onto dry land with some relief, look around at the prison, humbled. 103.
(TO PIENAAR)
imagine being able to see cape town so close by.
PIENAAR
that would make it worse. they head towards the prison entrance, slowly becoming a tighter and tighter bunch. the ghosts of mandela, and all the others who spent much of their lives here, are very strong.
CUT TO:
various shots of the springbok party, in the exercise yard, the lime quarry, the mess hall. none of the usual horsing around. this place affects them, deeply.
INT. ROBBEN ISLAND PRISON - SECTION B - DAY
section b is the bleak political wing. tiny cells line each side of a damp concrete hallway. a prison guard shows the springboks into the hallway, and they dwarf it, as they stand there, shocked. shocked at what was done in their names. this group is as quiet as we have ever seen them.
PIENAAR
can we see the president's cell?
PRISON GUARD
yes, of course. (leading them down past
THE CELLS)
we've done it up just the way it was. they reach a cell with a piece of white cardboard on the door, showing the number 466/64 -- mandela's prison number.
PRISON GUARD
(pointing at the number) that means he was the 466th prisoner admitted in 1964. the prison guard unlocks the door, pulls it open, then unlocks the metal grill that is the inside door. 104.
INT. MANDELA'S CELL - DAY
pienaar peers into the cell. it is tiny. there is no bed, just a sisal mat on the concrete floor, with a couple of blankets. a chamber pot, a short bench, a tin cup and plate are the only other objects in the room. a couple of small lockers are screwed high to the wall. the barred window is opaque. it lets in light but does not allow the prisoner a view. when pienaar enters, we see how small the cell really is. he can reach out and touch the opposite walls at the same time. this is a bleak, horrible, dehumanizing place. pienaar is stunned by it. he turns, slowly, looking at mandela's world for over twenty years.
INT. ROBBEN ISLAND PRISON - SECTION B - DAY
the other springboks and their partners wait to look into the cell themselves, a little puzzled by how much time pienaar's taking.
INT. MANDELA'S CELL - DAY
pienaar almost looks as if he is in a trance. he hears mandela's voice in the cell with him.
(RECITING "INVICTUS")
out of the night that covers me, black as the pit from pole to pole, i thank whatever gods may be for my unconquerable soul. now, pienaar sees mandela in prison clothes, in the cell. (the image is unclear, ghostly.)
MANDELA (V.O.)
in the fell clutch of circumstance i have not winced nor cried aloud. under the bludgeonings of chance my head is bloody, but unbow'd. pienaar sees mandela sitting on the dirt in the prison yard, breaking up rock with a hammer, along with rows of other political prisoners. 105.
MANDELA (V.O.)
beyond this place of wrath and tears looms but the horror of the shade, and yet the menace of the years finds and shall find me unafraid. pienaar sees mandela leading his fellow prisoners to the lime quarry, to mine lime under the eye of a guard who looks like pienaar.
MANDELA (V.O.)
it matters not how strait the gate, how charged with punishment the scroll, i am the master of my fate: i am the captain of my soul.
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
the gates open. linga gets out of one bmw, hendrick out of the other. we know the routine. only, mandela doesn't appear for his walk. linga and hendrick wait for a moment, then head in through the gate --
EXT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
-- break into a sprint, when they see mandela's form, crumpled on the lawn.
INT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - MORNING
barbara, mary, the house staff, plus linga, hendrick, etienne and jason, all wait. all are scared. nobody talks. the sound of footsteps from on the top floor brings them to their feet. mandela's doctor descends the stairs.
BARBARA
what happened?
DOCTOR
it's simple exhaustion, but it'll lead to worse if it's not treated. he needs complete rest. and i don't mean just shifting the affairs of state to his bedroom.
(MORE)
106.
DOCTOR (CONT'D)
no phone calls, no visitors, no meetings. no politics.
MARY
you know him. he won't do that.
DOCTOR
then i'm going to put him into hospital. in isolation.
BARBARA
no. not yet. i'll threaten him with hospital if he doesn't behave.
MARY
i'll cancel everything.
DOCTOR
and i'll come back tonight to make sure he's not working. the doctor leaves. the rest of them look at each other, relieved ... and maybe a little guilty, for letting things get this bad.
BARBARA
(to mary, aside) don't cancel the trip to taiwan. not yet.
INT. MANDELA'S BEDROOM - DAY
dark. curtains drawn. the door opens quietly. a shaft of light from the door shows mandela, on his back in bed, eyes closed. barbara enters. the sight of mandela lying like this is chilling. it is too close to what he would look like lying in a casket. barbara makes sure he is breathing. he is. she unplugs his phone, takes it. unplugs his tv. sweeps the room for papers, articles, legal briefs. for the first time, she takes an arm load of stuff away from him. she gives mandela one last, long look, closes the door behind her. we stay behind and look at mandela, and ponder south africa's fate if this were worse than just deep, sedated sleep.
DISSOLVE TO:
107.
EXT. SPRINGBOK TRAINING FACILITY - DAY
chester williams jogs under the tense eye of coach, trainer, manager and pienaar. he accelerates, running fast, but not sprinting.
COACH
that's not good enough. chester opens it up. full sprint, sustained. pienaar grins. chester is back.
COACH
let's hope the samoans don't injure it again.
EXT. ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY
one, brief shot of a typically brutal samoan tackle, and the ensuing foul play in the maul.
CUT TO:
four quick shots of chester williams scoring four tries.
CUT TO:
one more shot of the springboks trudging off the field. every single player is bruised or bleeding, or both.
INT. MANDELA'S OFFICE - DAY
looking frail, but better than before, mandela pencils in a score on the world cup bracket diagram: south africa 42, western samoa 14. the diagram shows us that this was a quarter final match. we can see that he has entered all the south african scores. (for the record: south africa 27 - australia 18; south africa 21 - romania 3; south africa 20 - canada 0.) for the semi-finals, against south africa, mandela pencils in france. 108. on the other side of the bracket, mandela pencils in england vs. the all blacks. with a satisfied grunt, mandela steps back from the diagram. things are shaping up nicely. a knock at the door, and barbara enters, ushering in a group
BARBARA
madiba, this is --
MANDELA
i know who this is. beaming, exuding energy we know he doesn't have, mandela rises to yet another occasion. he strides forward to shake hands.
MANDELA
welcome, and thank you for coming such a long way to see me.
INT. LUXURY BUS - DAY
monsoon rain batters the bus as it crawls towards king's park stadium, in durban.
EXT. KING'S PARK STADIUM - DAY
rain, rain, rain. the field is flooding.
INT. SPRINGBOK DRESSING ROOM - DAY
coach walks in on his team, who are dressed for the match and ready to go.
COACH
forty minute postponement. they're trying to clear the field.
CUT TO:
109.
EXT. KING'S PARK STADIUM - EVENING
a hundred zulu cleaning ladies with brooms and squeegees push the water off the field. capacity crowd cheers them on. (this happened. there will be stock footage.)
INT. SPRINGBOK DRESSING ROOM - EVENING
the boys stretch, jump, try to keep warmed-up.
INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE, TAIWAN - DAY
mandela and a negotiating team are meeting with their opposite numbers from taiwan. a high-level affair that cannot be interrupted. nonetheless, mandela takes a discreet look at his watch, and we realize that his mind is back home, with the springboks.
INT. SPRINGBOK DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
pienaar leads his men out into the rain.
EXT. KING'S PARK STADIUM - NIGHT
a quagmire, despite the efforts of the zulu ladies. muddy green and gold against the muddy blue, white and red of france. end of a close game. both teams are tired, muddy and desperate. the french assault the springbok try line, wave after wave. the springboks defend valiantly, but slowly go backwards. finally, the french score a try -- or do they? close-up on the rugby ball, under a mountain of muddy men, on the ground three inches outside the try line. 110. the referee waves off the try.
INT. PRESIDENT'S JET - DAY
mandela flies home, still working intensely with a mixed south african/taiwanese trade group. mary slips a piece of paper in front of him, discreetly.
WE'RE IN THE FINALS!!! GO BOKKE!!!
mandela's face betrays nothing. but, he gets up.
MANDELA
please excuse me for a moment. with mary leading the way, mandela goes to the back of the plane, looking grave and leaderly -- -- but once he is through the galley curtain, he breaks into a huge smile.
MANDELA
this is very good ... very good! who is our opponent?
MARY
the all blacks play england tomorrow. then, we'll know.
MANDELA
please make sure that my schedule is clear for the entire match.
MARY
yes, madiba.
INT. SUN CITY RESORT - DAY
on a big screen tv in a private banquet room, the springbok team watches the england/all black semi-final, which the all blacks dominate from beginning to end -- -- thanks to the exploits of jonah lomu, their unnaturally huge, fast left wing, of tongan parentage (and unanimous choice for the best player in the entire world cup). 111. jonah lomu scores in the first two minutes of the match, the first of four tries. he runs through, over, and around hapless defenders. his speed and balance are almost unprecedented in a man his size. the springboks go quiet as they watch this beating by the all blacks.
INT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - DAY
mandela watches at home with barbara and mary.
MANDELA
let's do some work while we watch. barbara resists her natural impulse to work and says:
BARBARA
just enjoy the rugby.
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MANDELA'S HOUSE - DAY
the sound of the match on the radio of one of the bmws. johan lomu's name in every sentence. all the bodyguards are out of the cars, enjoying the winter sunshine as they listen to the match.
KWEZI
so, let me understand this. the all blacks are killing a team that thrashed us last year?
ETIENNE
thanks for reminding me. hendrick opens the trunk of their bmw, pulls out a rugby ball, shows it to linga. linga nods. okay. throw it.
INT. SUN CITY RESORT - DAY
another lomu try, and a ripple goes through the springboks. 112.
SPRINGBOK HOOKER
we're going to have to tackle better than the english, that's for sure.
PIENAAR
we do.
INT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - DAY
tv blares. barbara does some work. mandela comes and peeks over her shoulder --
MANDELA
are those the judicial appointments for the free state? -- and barbara shuts the file.
BARBARA
they'll keep until after the match.
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MANDELA'S HOUSE - DAY
a pile of guns in holsters, on the hood of a bmw. suit jackets draped over the side mirrors. in the wide street, in their shirts and ties, the boys toss the ball around. the white bodyguards handle the ball expertly, the black bodyguards for the first time in their lives.
ETIENNE
give it a spin when you pass it.
(DEMONSTRATING)
like this. kwezi catches the ball, tries to throw it with spin, blows it. the ball bounces crazily all over the street, seems to have a mind of its own as it eludes kwezi. they all laugh.
CUT TO:
113.
INT. SUN CITY RESORT - DAY
lomu scores his third try.
SPRINGBOK WING
how much does lomu weigh?
SPRINGBOK FLANK
about 120 kilos.
SPRINGBOK LOCK
shit, that's what i weigh.
SPRINGBOK WING
ja, but at least you're slow. as we will discover, the wing is going to have to defend against lomu.
INT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - DAY
mandela isn't watching tv. he's at the window, looking out at a game of touch rugby, taking place on the street outside his house.
MANDELA
come and look at this.
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MANDELA'S HOUSE - DAY
two mixed teams. hendrick passes to linga, who passes back to hendrick, who scores.
(PANTING)
you should've played rugby.
(PANTING)
they wouldn't let me carry my gun. laughter. this scene was unthinkable a year ago.
CUT TO:
114.
INT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - DAY
barbara and mary stand next to mandela at the window. mandela's eyes twinkle with pleasure as he hears the laughter. in a way, this small moment already justifies everything he has done. almost. he gives barbara a sly look.
MANDELA
do you still think i'm wasting my time with the rugby? before barbara can reply, excitement on the tv makes mandela turn away. he looks at the tv just as lomu scores his fourth try, to make it 42 - 15. mandela shakes his head, awed.
MANDELA
barbara, can you please tell the minister of sport that i need a detailed briefing on the all blacks. barbara gives mandela a long look.
BARBARA
this rugby, it's still strictly political?
MANDELA
oh yes. of course.
INT. PIENAAR PARENT'S HOUSE - DAY
pienaar hands an envelope to his father.
PIENAAR
don't lose them. i won't be able to get more. mr. pienaar opens the envelope, pulls out tickets to the world cup final. mr. pienaar kisses the tickets.
MR. PIENAAR
thanks, francois. (fanning out tickets) me, mom, nerine -- wait, and the fourth? who's it for? 115. pienaar looks at his father, mischief in his eyes.
EXT. FREEWAY - END OF THE DAY
bmw, mercedes, bmw, driving from pretoria to johannesburg at the end of the day. red winter sunset over the arid highveld. go `boks, go amabokoboko signs, side by side. chester and pienaar billboards.
MINISTER OF SPORT (V.O.)
the all blacks beat ireland 43 to 19 --
INT. PRESIDENT'S MERCEDES - DAY
the minister of sport gives mandela his final briefing. at his side, barbara thrusts papers in front of mandela for his signature. this continues throughout.
MINISTER OF SPORT
-- they beat wales 34 to 9, they beat japan 145 to 17.
MANDELA
145 points, in one match? linga listens openly.
MINISTER OF SPORT
it's a new international record. (back to the briefing) they beat scotland 48 to 30 in the quarter finals. you saw the match with england.
MANDELA
45 to 29. and it was not that close.
(BEAT)
they seem unstoppable.
MINISTER OF SPORT
if opposing teams play them straight up, jonah lomu runs wild. if they focus on lomu, that leaves others free.
(BEAT)
and, also, there's the business of the haka. 116.
MANDELA
their maori war dance. yes. it's very powerful.
MINISTER OF SPORT
my sources tell me that half of the all black matches are won before the first whistle, because of it. mandela peers out of the window at a springbok billboard.
MANDELA
how are we going to beat them?
MINISTER OF SPORT
i have the coach's number. you could call him and ask.
MANDELA
no ... no. i don't want to break their focus for even a minute.
(INTENSE)
but, how do we win? on linga: an idea occurs to him. a wild idea. he almost turns and blurts it out -- restrains himself.
MINISTER OF SPORT
maybe we won't. they're favored two-to-one.
(BEAT)
madiba, we've already exceeded all expectations. on and off the field.
MANDELA
it's not enough. not now. not so close.
(BEAT)
this country is hungry for greatness. barbara pushes another paper in front of mandela. he signs it.
INT. SPRINGBOK COACH'S OFFICE - EVENING
the coach, the manager and pienaar gather for a final briefing in the coach's spartan office. 117.
COACH
how's the feeling in the dressing room?
PIENAAR
calm.
MANAGER
and lomu? are they talking about him? pienaar shrugs -- of course. coach grins.
COACH
nobody gives us a bloody chance. i like that. it plays into their one weakness. both pienaar and the manager look at the coach.
COACH
their vanity.
(BEAT)
they're already counting the win. but they want to win with style, the way they won all their other matches. they want to show the world how beautiful all black rugby is.
(GLARING)
i just want to show the bloody world how hard we tackle. pienaar's up for that.
PIENAAR
i wish tomorrow was already here.
INT. SECURITY OFFICE - ELLIS PARK - NIGHT
jason wishes tomorrow was already over. he goes through his plans, his check lists for the tenth time. he sighs, tries to roll the tension out of his shoulders, gives up. he leaves the office. 118.
I/E ELLIS PARK STADIUM - NIGHT
cops at their posts. jason walks alone through the tunnels, until he comes to a field entrance. he goes to the edge, looks out at the dimly lit field, trying to imagine tomorrow.
ETIENNE
(from behind him) come on, man. there's nothing more you can do today. jason turns to etienne.
JASON
have i ever mentioned to you that i hate rugby?
ETIENNE
once or twice, yes.
JASON
i just want to get him through tomorrow, safely. that's all.
ETIENNE
we all do. a look between the two men: they are united. they have come a long way.
INT. PIENAAR'S HOTEL ROOM - JOHANNESBURG - NIGHT
as in cape town, pienaar stares out into the night, pensively. preoccupied. so preoccupied, that when nerine enters quietly, he hardly turns.
NERINE
i brought one of your mom's protein shakes. pienaar nods, thanks. nerine puts the protein shake down. she tries to read pienaar's mood, see what he needs from her at this moment.
NERINE
thinking about tomorrow? 119.
PIENAAR
no, tomorrow's taken care of, one way or another. pienaar turns to her.
PIENAAR
i'm thinking about how you spend 30 years in a tiny cell, but come out ready to forgive the people who put you there.
INT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
we have seen that solitary shape under the blankets before. we have seen the clock on the bedside table change from 4:59 to 5:00 before. we have seen mandela's eyes open, immediately. but we have never seen mandela roll over and go back to sleep.
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
the two bwms wait faithfully.
INT. GREY BMW (LEAD) - NIGHT
linga looks at his watch.
INT. GREY BMW (TRAILER) - NIGHT
hendrick does the same. gets out.
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
linga gets out, meets hendrick at the gate.
LINGA
big day.
HENDRICK
be an even bigger day if we actually won. 120. then, they both look at their watches again.
HENDRICK
where is he? they share a worried look. linga reaches for his radio.
INT. MANDELA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
mandela's bedroom door is opened from outside the room. light from the hallway hits the bed. mandela looks very still under the covers. mary peers in, concern wiping away sleep. she sees mandela lying there. mary tiptoes in, concern growing, until she stands over mandela -- -- who opens his eyes without moving otherwise.
MANDELA
can a man not sleep in, when he has a big day ahead of him?
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
mary's voice on linga's radio.
(INTO RADIO)
okay, thanks. out. linga lowers his radio, embarrassed.
LINGA
he's sleeping in.
HENDRICK
or was. linga and hendrick stand at the gate for a moment, then turn to head back to their respective cars. linga pauses.
LINGA
i had an idea. about today.
(BEAT)
it's a crazy idea. 121.
HENDRICK
hey, don't worry, man. i already know you're crazy.
INT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
mandela eats breakfast -- porridge and fresh fruit -- and looks over the newspaper headlines, all screaming about today's world cup final. the doorbell rings, and he pauses, listens to the sound of voices at the door -- then the sound of heavy footsteps approaching through the house. mandela wipes his mouth and waits. linga and hendrick appear in the doorway. they look even bigger indoors.
MANDELA
morning, boys.
LINGA & HENDRICK
morning, madiba.
MANDELA
what is it? linga hesitates -- until hendrick gives him a (for hendrick) discreet nudge.
HENDRICK
linga had an idea, sir.
EXT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - DAY
mary walks briskly to her car, gets in and drives towards the opening gate, fast.
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MANDELA'S HOUSE - MORNING
linga and hendrick watch as mary drives away. 122.
HENDRICK
now you've done it.
EXT. JOHANNESBURG STREETS - DAY
as in cape town, the springboks jog through the streets. as in cape town, cars toot their horns, people cheer. but the crowd running with them is twice as large as it was in cape town -- and twice as black. this crowd shows that the springboks really do have the support of the whole country now. as the `boks rumble past, newspaper vendors, gardeners, pharmacy delivery men on small motorbikes abandon their tasks and run alongside the team. pienaar turns to look at one of his teammates, grins, gets a grin in return.
INT. SECURITY OFFICE - ELLIS PARK - DAY
jason addresses his entire team (minus linga), plus assorted
JASON
the tickets sold out long before the team became so popular. so it's not exactly going to be the rainbow nation out there. that's the reality.
(BEAT)
the president will greet the players before the match, he'll present the trophy after the match. he'll be exposed to 62,000 people, twice. he'll be on tv, live, all over the world. (expressing his deepest
FEAR)
all it takes is one idiot trying to make a statement, or one crazy fool who thinks he hears god speaking to him over the radio. one of the cops smiles at that. 123.
JASON
it's happened before!
(SUPER INTENSE)
but not today. not on our watch. not today. the security boys are fired up.
EXT. OUTSIDE ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY
it is hours before the match, but every entrance to ellis park stadium is chaotic with people, cars, face painters, flag sellers, fruit vendors. cops everywhere, and everywhere outnumbered. in the crowd outside, we find sipho, collecting empty bottles from trash cans, for recycling. jason was right about the demographics of the crowd: white, khaki-clad, quite a few old south african flags among the sea of new flags. springbok colors everywhere. we may even see the four boere from the lions debacle earlier.
(TO BOERE)
face flag?
BOER
bugger off! ellis park isn't exactly the rainbow nation today.
BOLAND BOTHA (V.O.)
we're at ellis park on this historic day, where, even this early, crowd excitement is at fever
PITCH --
boland does another live remote. fans cheer and wave behind
BOLAND BOTHA
-- because their beloved green and gold have somehow managed to exceed all expectations.
CUT TO:
124.
EXT. SPRINGBOK HOTEL - JOHANNESBURG - DAY
a luxury bus pulls away from the hotel, with a full police
BOLAND BOTHA (V.O.)
but now they come up against a team that is unlike any other they have played.
INT. LUXURY BUS - DAY
with that inward look of boxers before a big fight, the springboks begin the journey to the stadium.
BOLAND BOTHA (V.O.)
these all blacks are possibly one of the greatest international sides ever, with a player in jonah lomu who is as dominant as any this correspondent has ever seen.
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MANDELA'S HOUSE - DAY
mandela's mercedes exits his gate, bmws fore and aft.
BOLAND BOTHA (V.O.)
to lose to them is no disgrace. to lose to them in the finals is, in fact, an honor.
INT. PRESIDENT'S MERCEDES - DAY
tight on mandela's face, absolutely expressionless. his game face.
BOLAND BOTHA (V.O.)
i say this with absolutely no negativity. i simply want to save people from the heartbreak of unrealistic expectations.
CUT TO:
125.
EXT. OUTSIDE ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY
back to boland's live remote.
BOLAND BOTHA
so, take a reality check, sit back and share an afternoon with one billion fellow fans around the world. and as you do, feel a special pride in having made it this far. this is boland botha, signing off and sitting back at ellis park. huge crowd now, all around the tv truck, streaming in.
EXT. LUXURY BUS - DAY
driving down a secure access lane, the springbok bus and police escort approach ellis park. and pass sipho, who stares up at them from the sidewalk.
INT. LUXURY BUS - DAY
the boys are very quiet -- until the sheer spectacle gets to them. then, the first nerves hit. you can tell in the way they look at each other, the way they swallow.
EXT. OUTSIDE ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY
mandela's convoy pulls up at a secure entrance.
EXT. ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY
stadium almost full. crowd noise a dull roar. above the springbok bench, near the field, we find nerine, mr. and mrs. pienaar ... and eunice, as they take their seats. pienaar got the fourth ticket for her. 126. eunice turns to mrs. pienaar.
EUNICE
what's mr. francois doing now?
INT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY
all dressed, all warmed up, the springboks are quiet, introspective. everything that should be said has been said. this is the calm before the storm. (note that almost every player wears bandages, or braces, or is injured in some way.) pienaar is not in the room.
I/E ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY
dressed in his rugby togs, pienaar sneaks up the ramp to the edge of the field, takes a peek out of the tunnel -- -- and is blown away by the magnitude of it all.
EXT. AERIAL SHOT OF JOHANNESBURG - DAY
vast city seen from the air. zero in on ellis park.
CUT TO:
another angle of a south african airways 747 flying over the city, in the direction of ellis park.
CO-PILOT
final approach, captain.
CAPTAIN
let it be noted that i'm taking control of the aircraft.
ANGLE BACK THROUGH THE COCKPIT -- NO PASSENGERS.
127.
CAPTAIN
i assume full responsibility for what happens from now on.
CO-PILOT
duly noted. the captain drops the nose of the 747 towards ellis park.
EXT. ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY
every seat full. almost every seat filled by a big white man. excitement unbearable. jason stalks the runways between the seating sections, high in the stadium. binoculars around his neck, radio in hand. something catches his eye. something in the air. jason lifts his binoculars to his eyes. pov through binoculars -- the 747 is heading right for the stadium. jason lowers his binoculars. he frowns -- more puzzled than alarmed. (this is pre-9/11.) he lifts his radio to his mouth.
(INTO RADIO)
do you see that jet, to the east?
CUT TO:
etienne, in another part of the stadium, looks eastwards -- sees it.
(INTO RADIO)
did they get clearance for this?
(INTO RADIO)
not from us. the 747 gets closer, fast. jason is hit by a horrible thought. 128.
(INTO RADIO)
where is he?
VIP BOX.
jason finds the vip box, looks out at the 747 -- -- and realizes that the jet is heading straight at that side of the stadium.
(INTO RADIO)
get him out of there. now.
INT. VIP BOXES - ELLIS PARK - DAY
mandela is not in his seat. linga turns. hendrick points at the closed door of the vip bathroom.
(INTO RADIO)
no time.

nothing jason can do about it but hold his breath as --
INT. 747 COCKPIT - DAY
the captain drops the 747 even lower.

jason has to fight down the impulse to flee.
SMASH CUT TO:

INT. VIP BOXES - ELLIS PARK - DAY
everyone in the vip box sees the jet. they all stand.
EXT. ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY
the 747 nose appears over the rim of the stadium.
CAPTAIN
full throttle. captain and co-pilot go full throttle, yank the 747 straight upwards.
EXT. ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY
the almighty roar of full throttles fills the stadium, as the 747 passes less than 200 feet overhead -- -- so that everyone can read the huge letters painted on the bottom of the wings:
GOOD LUCK BOKKE
(this really happened.)
THE CROWD GOES WILD.
jason nearly faints with relief.
INT. VIP BOXES - ELLIS PARK - DAY
linga and hendrick share a look. they have just had a brush with the unthinkable.
INT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY
the dressing room vibrates with the roar ... 130.
SPRINGBOK WING
what the hell was that? ... which slowly fades ... ... leaving only the background roar of the revved up crowd. the boys jog in place, dying for the release of rugby. pienaar appears to be praying, silently.
INT. ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY
the referee walks off the field, into the tunnel, stands there for a moment, then raises his whistle to his mouth and blows a long, echoing blast --
INT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY
-- which is the signal to come to the field. the cop opens the door, throws down a full parade ground salute as pienaar leads his men out of the dressing room.
PIENAAR
breathe, boys. breathe.
INT. ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY
with the `boks, we head down the hallway, down some stairs to the tunnel onto the field -- -- where the referee holds his hand up like a traffic cop, keeping the boys in a line in the tunnel. as they wait, they hear the crunching approach of big men in
CLEATS.
down the opposite stairway come the all blacks. this is the first time we have seen them in the flesh. huge men, black on black uniforms, arrogant. been here before, done this before. the best in the world, expecting nothing but the best from the day. they ignore the springboks, dismiss them, line up next to them in the tunnel. 131. the sound of thirty men jogging in place in their cleats, on the concrete, sounds like a drum roll before a medieval battle. the springbok wing sneaks a peek at jonah lomu. the biggest, fastest wing ever. even bigger looking in this confined space. bigger than the springbok wing, bigger than any of the springbok backs, bigger than most of the springbok forwards. the referee nods to both captains, turns, and leads them onto the field --
EXT. ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY
-- where the already-whipped up crowd goes crazy, as both teams sprint onto the field and go through their brief warm- up ritual. we focus on the crowd, focus on how white and old south africa most of them are. the referee blows his whistle again, and both teams assemble in a line, facing each other. glaring like boxers across immaculate green grass.
INT. ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY
seen only in silhouette, mandela walks down the tunnel. he is flanked by jason, the minister of sport and the president of sa rugby. linga, as always, has mandela's back. plus hendrick.
EXT. ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY
mandela emerges into daylight, wearing not a suit, not a madiba shirt -- -- he is wearing francois pienaar's green and gold number 6 rugby jersey. on his head is the springbok cap given to him by the team in
CAPE TOWN
the crowd catches its breath. this is unprecedented, shocking ... and brilliant. the springboks digest this extraordinary display of support. 132.
SPRINGBOK HOOKER
(murmuring to pienaar) the all blacks won't like that. pienaar nods, eyes glinting. mandela is giving them an edge. as he walks towards the waiting teams, mandela lifts the springbok cap high, waves it, and fires his famous, beautiful, huge, african smile at the crowd -- -- who roar and stand, slowly, and start chanting, slowly ...
CROWD
nelson ... nelson ... nelson ...
NELSON ... NELSON ... NELSON ...
63 000 south africans, chanting as one.
A QUICK SERIES OF SHOTS
all across south africa, the chant echoes through empty streets. not a soul, not a car to be seen. everyone is inside, watching tv.
... NELSON ... NELSON ... NELSON
... etc. mandela shakes hands with the springboks, who are brimming with pride. mandela shakes chester williams' hand with special energy.
MANDELA
i'm so glad you're here. chester beams.
CUT TO:
in the stands, eunice ululates, loud african warrior woman call. mr. pienaar looks at her, shocked. looks at her as a person for the first time, maybe.
DO THAT AGAIN!
133. eunice ululates again.
CUT TO:
on the field, mandela shakes hands with the all blacks, who, as predicted, don't like his partisan clothing. mandela looks up at jonah lomu.
MANDELA
hello, jonah. lomu looks down at mandela, eyes glowing with aggression -- -- and suddenly, he bares his tattooed tongan tongue in a
FIERCE WAR CRY.
as do the rest of the all blacks. we have segued to the famous haka, a maori war dance that tells an opponent they're going have their daughters stolen, their wives ravaged and their brains eaten right out of their skulls with a sharpened tea spoon. it is abundantly clear why, as the minister of sports told mandela, half of the all blacks matches are won before the whistle blows. this is very intimidating. especially because, this day, the all blacks push the haka closer and closer to the springboks -- -- who do not back down. in fact, they close ranks and advance. major, major international smackdown. this is not fake. the emotions, the aggression are real. on mandela, whose diplomatic mask slips a little showing a warrior's glitter in his eyes. he wants to respond, primally. his fists clench at his side. the haka ends with a fearsome, guttural maori yell. on the springboks, massed together, faces red with emotion, pulses racing. mandela takes a deep breath in. then the boys answer. with, of course, a terrorist anthem of their own: nkosi
SIKELEL' IAFRIKA.
134. pienaar starts it.
ALL SPRINGBOKS
-- sikelel' iafrika etc ... with decent pronunciation, with full fervor and heart, the boys roar the anthem back at the all blacks. the crowd joins them. "nkosi" roars through the stadium, through the nation. on mandela: his heart swells, as he sings with his people.
CUT TO:
on jason, who stands surrounded by his former enemies singing the song that kept him -- kept all of them -- going through the apartheid years. in this stadium, at this moment, all hostility, all fear, are a thing of the past. the tension finally goes out of jason's shoulders. on jason's face, close to tears, as nkosi slowly fades. as mandela said -- a very inspirational song. begin heartbeat over. is that a heartbeat, or an african drum?
CUT TO:
on the field, the all black fly half tees up the ball, for kick off. as the fly half back-pedals slowly, and pauses in readiness, waiting for the whistle --
CUT AWAY:
to rainbow nation faces, poised all over south africa, watching on tv and in the stands. heart/drumbeat over. the last face is sipho's.
EXT. OUTSIDE ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY
the crowd noise spills out of the stadium behind sipho. 135. a radio plays nearby, tuned to the game. the radio is in a cop car, manned by two beefy white cops. as the crowd noise rises, sipho edges closer to the cops. they eye him out.
INT. VIP BOXES - ELLIS PARK - DAY
mandela front and center. minister of sport to his right, prime minister of new zealand to his left, president of sa rugby next to him. both using all their diplomatic skills to stay cool.
MANDELA
(to nz p.m.) perhaps we should make a small wager?
NEW ZEALAND P.M.
all your gold, for all our sheep?
MANDELA
i was thinking more along the lines of a case of wine. behind mandela, linga and hendrick suppress grins. they are outwardly professional -- but bursting with excitement.
EXT. ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY
the referee blows his whistle. the all black fly half boots the ball towards the springboks, charges after it, along with the rest of the all blacks. game on. we have only seen snippets of rugby, so far. and mostly from a somewhat polite distance -- the usual distance of tv coverage. say, at closest, the referee's point of view. not now. not for the climax. we experience this beautiful piece of mayhem up close and personal. we're inside the heaving scrums. we are the ball. we see the way cleats leave a pattern of round white dimples on abused skin, which quickly turn to purple as they fill with subcutaneous blood. 136. we feel a tackle in our own spine; we see teeth sink into flesh in the intimacy of a loose scrum; we feel a hard fist smacking us again and again in the hot privacy of a rolling maul. for this is not a pretty match, not for one moment -- just as the springbok coach wanted. this match is all about a less talented team stifling the best team in the world by sheer determination and fitness. this is about the springboks applying continuous, unrelenting pressure, and forcing the vaunted all black attack into making mistakes. lots of them. dropped balls, errant passes, knock-ons. no fluency of movement, no electric building of momentum. because of one thing: tackling. tackling and tackling and tackling again. the first time lomu touches the ball, the stadium, the nation holds its breath -- -- until the springbok wing scythes into him at thigh height, wraps him up and brings him down. the second time lomu gets the ball he is brought down from behind by pienaar, with a picture perfect tackle. we can cut away to the faces of the spectators when we want; from mandela to nerine to sipho and on and on, all over the country. but, in truth, our attention belongs on the field. on pienaar, continually exhorting his men, leading by example, wreaking havoc in the all black backfield. on lomu, who always seems just one broken tackle away from running one in -- except that there are no broken tackles. on thirty big, strong, battle-scarred men, who have devoted their entire lives to this moment. they are not playing for money. they are playing for pride, for their countries. outdated notions. we miss them. no tries are scored in the final. the two fly halves match each other, penalty goal for penalty goal. with each made kick, the goal posts shrink for the next. the penalty goals are unchallenged. it is up to the kicker to make them or fail. that is pressure. 137. the score is 6 - 6 when, just before half time, the springbok fly half takes a long, perfect pass from the scrum half, and with the all black defenders looming, kicks a drop goal through the uprights. the springboks lead 9 - 6. a tight match. so tight, in fact, that there is only one score in the second half -- an all black drop goal that levels the score at 9 - 9. until right before the end of the match, when the all blacks camp in the springbok half. the scrum half sends a long, spiralling pass to the fly half, who is in perfect position to go for a drop goal. the kick soars into the air, high and straight. 43 million south africans hold their breath. all around the world, fans lean forward on their chairs. this will be the decisive blow. but the kick just goes wide. relief. the referee blows his whistle to signal the end of regulation. both teams are spent.
LINGA
what happens now?
HENDRICK
extra time. twenty minutes.
LINGA
i don't think i can take it. no one can. mandela paces. everyone is drained.
EXT. OUTSIDE ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY
sipho leans on the cop car, listening to the radio. he and the two cops suck nervously on sodas.
CUT TO:
138.
EXT. ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY
two sets of bruised, bleeding, exhausted, cramping men face each other for the extra time kick off. pienaar turns to his men.
PIENAAR
who's the fittest team on this field? the answer lies in their eyes: they are. an all black penalty goal makes it 12 - 9 almost immediately. a springbok penalty goal answers. 12 - 12. seven minutes from the end of extra time, the springboks earn a scrum deep in all blacks territory.
PIENAAR
keep it here. run it forward. the scrum goes down, wheels a little.
SPRINGBOK FLY HALF
francois! pienaar turns his head. the fly half taps his own chest: give me the ball. pienaar hesitates, then nods to the scrum half: give him the ball. the ball goes into the scrum. the ball works its way back through the feet of the eight springbok forwards. the scrum half gathers it, spins it out to the fly half -- -- who takes one step to his left and kicks a drop goal high into the air. ball soaring past a backdrop of open mouths. higher than the uprights ... ... but through them nonetheless. springboks 15 - 12 all blacks. an entire nation jumps to its feet. 139.
INT. VIP BOXES - ELLIS PARK - DAY
everyone is on their feet in the press box.
MANDELA
how long before the end?
MINISTER OF SPORT
seven minutes. they turn out to be the longest seven minutes in mandela's life. in every south african's life.
BEGIN CLIMAX SEQUENCE:
this is where we fold the rainbow nation into the rugby match, fully.
INTERCUT BETWEEN PEOPLE ALL OVER SOUTH AFRICA, AND THE RUGBY
as we show the whole nation wanting exactly the same thing at the same time. faces, postures, eyes are identical, no matter where they are, who they are, what color they are. (it would be nice if we used all the faces we've already cut away to throughout this story.)
ON THE FIELD
the all blacks attack desperately. the springboks tackle and tackle and tackle. on pienaar, totally spent but dragging himself to his feet for another tackle. he glances over at the referee, makes another tackle -- -- looks over at the referee -- -- the referee puts his hands on his whistle -- -- another tackle, another look -- -- the referee lifts the whistle to his lips -- -- another tackle, another look -- -- the referee blows the final whistle. it's over. the springboks have won. 140.
EXT. ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY
pandemonium on the field, pandemonium in the stands. jason is hugged by an ecstatic boer (jason is not a hugger).
CUT TO:
mrs. pienaar and nerine are in tears. mr. pienaar hugs a shocked eunice.
INT. VIP BOXES - ELLIS PARK - DAY
pandemonium in the vip box. mandela shakes hands with everyone he can find. it is way too loud to say anything. hendrick and linga almost hug. almost. they shake hands with total joy and engagement, whack each other on the shoulder.
EXT. OUTSIDE ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY
sipho toi-tois next to the cop car (a township war dance, very political). the two cops toi-toi with him.
CUT TO:
around the nation, an epidemic of hugging begins. this spills out onto the streets later, but for now, let's restrict this to the people who've been watching the match together.
EXT. ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY
the springboks say a prayer on the field. pienaar kneels in the middle, leading the prayer. behind them, a work crew assembles a portable podium. at "amen", pienaar's men lift him to his feet, then onto their shoulders. 141. the crowd roars again and again as pienaar takes a victory lap on the shoulders of the men he has led through thick and thin. tears stream down his face, through his unstoppable grin. as they near the podium, the team is intercepted by a news crew and -- -- none other then boland botha.
BOLAND BOTHA
francois ... a few words ... the interview booms through the pa system. pienaar just nods -- he isn't about to spoil the moment by reacting to this buffoon.
BOLAND BOTHA
... great game, but i don't think you could've done it without the amazing support of these 63,000 south africans -- francois grabs the mike from boland.
PIENAAR
(into mike, words booming) we didn't have the support of 63,000 south africans today. we had the support of 42 million south africans. the crowd roars. the springbok manager grabs pienaar's shoulder, points.
SPRINGBOK MANAGER
they're waiting for you over there. pienaar turns, looks. mandela waits at the podium, eyes alight with joy. in front of him is the william webb ellis trophy, a big gold confection. their eyes meet. their eyes stay locked as pienaar fights his way through the press, the officials, his own team, to the podium. 142. mandela holds out his hand. pienaar takes it. big hands, one black, one white, one with bruises visible, one with a lifetime of bruises implied. both wearing the number 6 springbok jersey.
MANDELA
francois, i want to thank you most sincerely for what you have done to our country. pienaar shakes his head.
PIENAAR
mr. president, i want to thank you for what you have done. eyes lock again, for just a moment, blue eyes, brown eyes -- african eyes, both. and then pienaar raises the trophy high. a very traditional sports hero's moment, richly deserved. real gold, against the green of the battered field. but that is not the real prize. the prize is what happens next, all over the nation.
DISSOLVE TO:
all over south africa, people spill out into the streets, to celebrate. utter joy, everywhere, as black and white, servants and employers, strangers, enemies, foreigners are swept up in love and happiness. people who have been suspicious of each other, hated each other, feared each other all their lives ... they hug each other on this day.
EXT. JOHANNESBURG STREETS - END OF THE DAY
housewives, gardeners, cops, kids dance in the middle of the street. a car horn beeps politely. bmw, mercedes, bmw come slowly down the street. 143. the crowd begins to dance and ululate as they part to let the convoy through.
INT. PRESIDENT'S MERCEDES - END OF THE DAY
linga in front. mandela is alone in the back seat. he looks out at his people as they cheer him through. he also looks exhausted. spent. none of that shining life force that makes him so big.
(INTO RADIO)
this route's too crowded. we're changing to route b.
EXT. JOHANNESBURG STREETS - END OF THE DAY
the convoy switches to another street -- -- which is just as crowded as the first, with happy south africans. it is as if every single person in the rainbow nation wants to celebrate together.
(INTO RADIO)
change to route c.
EXT. JOHANNESBURG STREETS - END OF THE DAY
the convoy switches to yet another street -- -- to no avail. south africa is literally dancing in the streets.
INT. PRESIDENT'S MERCEDES - END OF THE DAY
mandela leans forward, taps linga on the shoulder. 144.
MANDELA
tell jason it's all right. there's no hurry.
(INTO RADIO)
madiba says no need to hurry.
INT. GREY BMW (LEAD) - END OF THE DAY
jason nods, puts down his radio, settles back with a deep sigh. so do the rest of the boys in the car. this day is almost over.
INT. GREY BMW (TRAILER) - END OF THE DAY
etienne, hendrick loosen their ties, bask in the feeling. hendrick looks out at the rolling street party -- and shakes his head in amazement.
INT. PRESIDENT'S MERCEDES - END OF THE DAY
president nelson rolihlahla mandela undoes the top button of his rugby jersey, settles back with a deep sigh -- -- and drives home through a nation that has begun the process of forgiving itself. his nation. go in on mandela's face as it settles into the now-familiar sphinx-like mask. except for his eyes. mandela's eyes glow with deep joy and satisfaction as he moves slowly through a moment in history that he has worked for, all his life.
